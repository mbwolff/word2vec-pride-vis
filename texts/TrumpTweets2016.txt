Happy Birthday @DonaldJTrumpJr!. 

Happy New Year to all, including to my many enemies and those who have fought me and lost so badly they just don't know what to do.  Love! 

Russians are playing @CNN and @NBCNews for such fools - funny to watch, they don't have a clue!  @FoxNews totally gets it! 

Join @AmerIcan32, founded by Hall of Fame legend @JimBrownNFL32 on 1/19/2017 in Washington, D. C.. 

Great move on delay (by V.  Putin) - I always knew he was very smart! 

My Administration will follow two simple rules. 

'Economists say Trump delivered hope'. 

not anymore.  The beginning of the end was the horrible Iran deal, and now this (U. N. )!  Stay strong Israel, January 20th is fast approaching! 

We cannot continue to let Israel be treated with such total disdain and disrespect.  They used to have a great friend in the U. S. , but....... 

Doing my best to disregard the many inflammatory President O statements and roadblocks. Thought it was going to be a smooth transition - NOT! 

The U. S.  Consumer Confidence Index for December surged nearly four points to 113. 7, THE HIGHEST LEVEL IN MORE THAN 15 YEARS!  Thanks Donald! 

President Obama campaigned hard (and personally) in the very important swing states, and lost. The voters wanted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The DJT Foundation, unlike most foundations, never paid fees, rent, salaries or any expenses.  100% of money goes to wonderful charities! 

I gave millions of dollars to DJT Foundation, raised or recieved millions more, ALL of which is given to charity, and media won't report! 

The world was gloomy before I won - there was no hope.  Now the market is up nearly 10% and Christmas spending is over a trillion dollars! 

The United Nations has such great potential but right now it is just a club for people to get together, talk and have a good time.  So sad! 

President Obama said that he thinks he would have won against me.  He should say that but I say NO WAY!  - jobs leaving, ISIS, OCare, etc. 

Merry Christmas and a very, very, very , very Happy New Year to everyone! 

#MerryChristmas. 

Happy #Hanukkah. 

The big loss yesterday for Israel in the United Nations will make it much harder to negotiate peace. Too bad, but we will get it done anyway! 

. @NBCNews purposely left out this part of my nuclear qoute: "until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes. "  Dishonest! 

Vladimir Putin said today about Hillary and Dems: "In my opinion, it is humiliating.  One must be able to lose with dignity. "  So true! 

slaughter you.  This is a purely religious threat, which turned into reality.  Such hatred!  When will the U. S. , and all countries, fight back? 

The terrorist who killed so many people in Germany said just before crime, "by God's will we will slaughter you pigs, I swear, we will...... 

As to the U. N. , things will be different after Jan.  20th. 

my presidency.  Isn't this a ridiculous shame?  He loves these kids, has raised millions of dollars for them, and now must stop.  Wrong answer! 

My wonderful son, Eric, will no longer be allowed to raise money for children with cancer because of a possible conflict of interest with... 

The so-called "A" list celebrities are all wanting tixs to the inauguration, but look what they did for Hillary, NOTHING.  I want the PEOPLE! 

Based on the tremendous cost and cost overruns of the Lockheed Martin F-35, I have asked Boeing to price-out a comparable F-18 Super Hornet! 

The United States must greatly strengthen and expand its nuclear capability until such time as the world comes to its senses regarding nukes\. 

Someone incorrectly stated that the phrase "DRAIN THE SWAMP" was no longer being used by me.  Actually, we will always be trying to DTS. 

The resolution being considered at the United Nations Security Council regarding Israel should be vetoed.... cont. 

I met some really great Air Force GENERALS and Navy ADMIRALS today, talking about airplane capability and pricing.  Very impressive people! 

I have not heard any of the pundits or commentators discussing the fact that I spent FAR LESS MONEY on the win than Hillary on the loss! 

I would have done even better in the election, if that is possible, if the winner was based on popular vote - but would campaign differently\. 

Campaigning to win the Electoral College is much more difficult & sophisticated than the popular vote.  Hillary focused on the wrong states! 

Yes, it is true - Carlos Slim, the great businessman from Mexico, called me about getting together for a meeting.  We met, HE IS A GREAT GUY! 

especially how to get people, even with an unlimited budget, out to vote in the vital swing states ( and more).  They focused on wrong states\. 

Bill Clinton stated that I called him after the election.  Wrong, he called me (with a very nice congratulations).  He "doesn't know much" ... 

@realDonaldTrump "@mike_pence: Congratulations to @RealDonaldTrump; officially elected President of the United States today by the Electoral College! "

"@Franklin_Graham: Congratulations to President-elect @realDonaldTrump--the electoral votes are in and it's official. " Thank you Franklin! 

We did it!  Thank you to all of my great supporters, we just officially won the election (despite all of the distorted and inaccurate media). 

Today there were terror attacks in Turkey, Switzerland and Germany - and it is only getting worse.  The civilized world must change thinking! 

If my many supporters acted and threatened people like those who lost the election are doing, they would be scorned & called terrible names! 

We should tell China that we don't want the drone they stole back. - let them keep it! 

Thank you Alabama!  From now on, it’s going to be #AmericaFirst.  Our goal is to bring back that wonderful phrase: #MadeInTheUSA!. 

China steals United States Navy research drone in international waters - rips it out of water and takes it to China in unprecedented act. 

Mobile, Alabama today at 3:00 P. M.  Last rally of the year - "THANK YOU ALABAMA AND THE SOUTH" Biggest of all crowds expected, see you there! 

"@EazyMF_E: @realDonaldTrump Many people are now saying you will be an extremely successful president!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain"  Thank you! 

Last night in Orlando, Florida, was incredible - massive crowd - THANK YOU FLORIDA!  Today at 3:00 P. M.  I will be in Alabama for last rally! 

Thank you Florida.  My Administration will follow two simple rules: BUY AMERICAN and HIRE AMERICAN!  #ICYMI- Watch. 

#ThankYouTour2016 Tonight- Orlando, Florida Tickets:   Mobile, AlabamaTickets:    – at Trump Tower\. 

Well, we all did it, together!  I hope the "MOVEMENT" fans will go to D. C.  on Jan 20th for the swearing in.  Let's set the all time record! 

Are we talking about the same cyberattack where it was revealed that head of the DNC illegally gave Hillary the questions to the debate? 

Thank you Pennsylvania!  Together, we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Watch here. 

Join me in Mobile, Alabama on Sat.  at 3pm!  #ThankYouTour2016 Tickets. 

If Russia, or some other entity, was hacking, why did the White House wait so long to act?  Why did they only complain after Hillary lost? 

The media tries so hard to make my move to the White House, as it pertains to my business, so complex - when actually it isn't! 

Thank you to Time Magazine and Financial Times for naming me "Person of the Year" - a great honor! 

Has anyone looked at the really poor numbers of @VanityFair Magazine.  Way down, big trouble, dead!  Graydon Carter, no talent, will be out! 

. @BillGates and @JimBrownNFL32 in my Trump Tower office yesterday- two great guys!. 

Thank you Wisconsin!  My Administration will be focused on three very important words: jobs, jobs, jobs!  Watch. 

Join me this Saturday at Ladd–Peebles Stadium in Mobile, Alabama!  #ThankYouTour2016 Tickets. 

The thing I like best about Rex Tillerson is that he has vast experience at dealing successfully with all types of foreign governments. 

Wisconsin and Pennsylvania have just certified my wins in those states.  I actually picked up additional votes! 

I have chosen one of the truly great business leaders of the world, Rex Tillerson, Chairman and CEO of ExxonMobil, to be Secretary of State. 

I will hold a press conference in the near future to discuss the business, Cabinet picks and all other topics of interest.  Busy times! 

Presidency.  Two of my children, Don and Eric, plus executives, will manage them.  No new deals will be done during my term(s) in office. 

Even though I am not mandated by law to do so, I will be leaving my busineses before January 20th so that I can focus full time on the...... 

I will be making my announcement on the next Secretary of State tomorrow morning. 

The final Wisconsin vote is in and guess what - we just picked up an additional 131 votes.  The Dems and Green Party can now rest.  Scam! 

#ThankYouTour2016 Tue: West Allis, WI.  Thur: Hershey, PA.  Fri: Orlando, FL.  Sat: Mobile, AL.  Tickets:    – at Trump Tower\. 

The F-35 program and cost is out of control.  Billions of dollars can and will be saved on military (and other) purchases after January 20th. 

Unless you catch "hackers" in the act, it is very hard to determine who was doing the hacking.  Why wasn't this brought up before election? 

Can you imagine if the election results were the opposite and WE tried to play the Russia/CIA card.  It would be called conspiracy theory! 

Just watched @NBCNightlyNews - So biased, inaccurate and bad, point after point.  Just can't get much worse, although @CNN is right up there! 

Will be interviewed on @FoxNews at 10:00 P. M.  Enjoy! 

Whether I choose him or not for "State"- Rex Tillerson, the Chairman & CEO of ExxonMobil, is a world class player and dealmaker.  Stay tuned! 

I spent Friday campaigning with John Kennedy, of the Great State of Louisiana, for the U. S. Senate.  The election is over - JOHN WON! 

Being at the Army - Navy Game was fantastic.  There is nothing like the spirit in that stadium.  A wonderful experience, and congrats to Army! 

I will be interviewed today on Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace at 10:00 (Eastern) Network.  ENJOY! 

October 2015 - thanks Chris Wallace @FoxNewsSunday!. 

A very interesting read.  Unfortunately, so much is true.. 

Reports by @CNN that I will be working on The Apprentice during my Presidency, even part time, are ridiculous & untrue - FAKE NEWS! 

As a show of support for our Armed Forces, I will be going to The Army-Navy Game today.  Looking forward to it, should be fun! 

I have NOTHING to do with The Apprentice except for fact that I conceived it with Mark B & have a big stake in it.  Will devote ZERO TIME! 

. @RudyGiuliani, one of the finest people I know and a former GREAT Mayor of N. Y. C. , just took himself out of consideration for "State". 

Thank you Michigan.  We are going to bring back your jobs & together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Watch. 

Thank you Louisiana!  Get out & vote for John Kennedy tomorrow.  Electing Kennedy will help enact our agenda on behalf of the people.. 

Join me live in Louisiana!  Tomorrow, we need you to go to the polls & send John Kennedy to the U. S.  Senate..

Today we lost a great pioneer of air and space in John Glenn.  He was a hero and inspired generations of future explorers.  He will be missed. 

If United Steelworkers 1999 was any good, they would have kept those jobs in Indiana.  Spend more time working-less time talking.  Reduce dues\. 

Chuck Jones, who is President of United Steelworkers 1999, has done a terrible job representing workers.  No wonder companies flee country! 

Join me tomorrow in Des Moines, Iowa with Vice President-Elect @mike_pence - at 7:00pm! #ThankYouTour2016 #MAGA   – at Trump Tower\. 

We pause today to remember the 2,403 American heroes who selflessly gave their lives at Pearl Harbor 75 years ago....

If the press would cover me accurately & honorably, I would have far less reason to "tweet. " Sadly, I don't know if that will ever happen! 

I am thrilled to nominate Dr.  @RealBenCarson as our next Secretary of the US Dept.  of Housing and Urban Development. 

their country (the U. S.  doesn't tax them) or to build a massive military complex in the middle of the South China Sea?   I don't think so! 

Did China ask us if it was OK to devalue their currency (making it hard for our companies to compete), heavily tax our products going into.. 

. @FoxNews will be re-running "Objectified: Donald Trump," the ratings hit produced by the great Harvey Levin of TMZ, at 8:00 P. M.  Enjoy! 

The Green Party just dropped its recount suit in Pennsylvania and is losing votes in Wisconsin recount.  Just a Stein scam to raise money! 

expensive mistake!  THE UNITED STATES IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS\. 

these companies are able to move between all 50 states, with no tax or tariff being charged.  Please be forewarned prior to making a very ... 

wanting to sell their product, cars, A. C.  units etc. , back across the border.  This tax will make leaving financially difficult, but..... 

without retribution or consequence, is WRONG!  There will be a tax on our soon to be strong border of 35% for these companies ...... 

fires its employees, builds a new factory or plant in the other country, and then thinks it will sell its product back into the U. S.   ...... 

The U. S.  is going to substantialy reduce taxes and regulations on businesses, but any business that leaves our country for another country,

Just tried watching Saturday Night Live - unwatchable!  Totally biased, not funny and the Baldwin impersonation just can't get any worse.  Sad\. 

Our great VPE, @mike_pence, is in Louisiana campaigning for John Kennedy for US Senate.  John will be a tremendous help to us in Washington. 

State Treasurer John Kennedy is my choice for US Senator from Louisiana.  Early voting today; election next Saturday. 

"@TigerWoods: Can’t wait to get back out there and mix it up with the boys.  –TW #heroworldchallenge" Great to have you back Tiger - Special! 

Rexnord of Indiana is moving to Mexico and rather viciously firing all of its 300 workers.  This is happening all over our country.  No more! 

Interesting how the U. S.  sells Taiwan billions of dollars of military equipment but I should not accept a congratulatory call. 

The President of Taiwan CALLED ME today to wish me congratulations on winning the Presidency.  Thank you! 

Heading to U. S.  Bank Arena in Cincinnati, Ohio for a 7pm rally.  Join me!  Tickets. 

Getting ready to leave for the Great State of Indiana and meet the hard working and wonderful people of Carrier A. C. 

My thoughts and prayers are with those affected by the tragic storms and tornadoes in the Southeastern United States.  Stay safe! 

Look forward to going to Indiana tomorrow in order to be with the great workers of Carrier.  They will sell many air conditioners! 

'Donald Trump is already helping the working class'. 

'President-elect Donald J.  Trump today announced his intent to nominate Steven Mnuchin, Wilbur Ross & Todd Ricketts'. 

Join me in Cincinnati, Ohio tomorrow evening at 7:00pm.  I am grateful for all of your support.  THANK YOU! Tickets. 

Hence, legal documents are being crafted which take me completely out of business operations.  The Presidency is a far more important task!

ISIS is taking credit for the terrible stabbing attack at Ohio State University by a Somali refugee who should not have been in our country. 

Big day on Thursday for Indiana and the great workers of that wonderful state. We will keep our companies and jobs in the U. S.  Thanks Carrier\. 

I will be going to Indiana on Thursday to make a major announcement concerning Carrier A. C.  staying in Indianapolis.  Great deal for workers! 

'President-Elect Donald J.  Trump Nominates Elaine Chao as Secretary of the Department of Transportation'. 

'President-Elect Donald J.  Trump Intends to Nominate Congressman Tom Price and Seema Verma. '. 

My thoughts and prayers are with the great people of Tennessee during these terrible wildfires.  Stay safe! 

Nobody should be allowed to burn the American flag - if they do, there must be consequences - perhaps loss of citizenship or year in jail! 

I thought that @CNN would get better after they failed so badly in their support of Hillary Clinton however, since election, they are worse! 

The Great State of Michigan was just certified as a Trump WIN giving all of our MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN supporters another victory - 306! 

. @CNN is so embarrassed by their total  (100%) support of Hillary Clinton, and yet her loss in a landslide, that they don't know what to do. 

"@sdcritic:  @HighonHillcrest @jeffzeleny @CNN There is NO QUESTION THAT #voterfraud did take place, and in favor of #CorruptHillary ! "

"@FiIibuster: @jeffzeleny Pathetic - you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame!  Bad reporter. 

"@JoeBowman12: @jeffzeleny just another generic CNN part time wannabe journalist ! "  @CNN still doesn't get it.  They will never learn! 

"@HighonHillcrest: @jeffzeleny what PROOF do u have DonaldTrump did not suffer from millions of FRAUD votes?  Journalist?  Do your job!  @CNN"

Just met with General Petraeus--was very impressed! 

If Cuba is unwilling to make a better deal for the Cuban people, the Cuban/American people and the U. S.  as a whole, I will terminate deal. 

Serious voter fraud in Virginia, New Hampshire and California - so why isn't the media reporting on this?  Serious bias - big problem! 

states instead of the 15 states that I visited.  I would have won even more easily and convincingly (but smaller states are forgotten)! 

It would have been much easier for me to win the so-called popular vote than the Electoral College in that I would only campaign in 3 or 4--

In addition to winning the Electoral College in a landslide, I won the popular vote if you deduct the millions of people who voted illegally\. 

Trump is going to be our President.  We owe him an open mind and the chance to lead. " So much time and money will be spent - same result!  Sad\. 

this election.  That is a direct threat to our democracy. " She then said, "We have to accept the results and look to the future, Donald --

Hillary Clinton conceded the election when she called me just prior to the victory speech and after the results were in.  Nothing will change\. 

The Democrats, when they incorrectly thought they were going to win, asked that the election night tabulation be accepted.  Not so anymore! 

The Green Party scam to fill up their coffers by asking for impossible recounts is now being joined by the badly defeated & demoralized Dems\. 

Fidel Castro is dead! 

I am working hard, even on Thanksgiving, trying to get Carrier A. C.  Company to stay in the U. S.  (Indiana).  MAKING PROGRESS - Will know soon! 

Happy Thanksgiving to everyone.  We will, together, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Let us give thanks for all that we have, and let us boldly face the exciting new frontiers that lie ahead.  Happy Thanksgiving.. 

Bus crash in Tennessee so sad & so terrible.  Condolences to all family members and loved ones.  These beautiful children will be remembered! 

I am seriously considering Dr.  Ben Carson as the head of HUD.  I've gotten to know him well--he's a greatly talented person who loves people! 

The meeting with the @nytimes is back on at 12:30 today.  Look forward to it! 

'Jeff Sessions, a Fitting Selection for Attorney General'. 

'President-elect Donald J.  Trump's CIA Director Garners Praise'. 

Great meetings will take place today at Trump Tower concerning the formation of the people who will run our government for the next 8 years. 

The failing @nytimes just announced that complaints about them are at a 15 year high.  I can fully understand that - but why announce? 

Perhaps a new meeting will be set up with the @nytimes.  In the meantime they continue to cover me inaccurately and with a nasty tone! 

I cancelled today's meeting with the failing @nytimes when the terms and conditions of the meeting were changed at the last moment.  Not nice\. 

Many people would like to see @Nigel_Farage represent Great Britain as their Ambassador to the United States.  He would do a great job! 

Prior to the election it was well known that I have interests in properties all over the world. Only the crooked media makes this a big deal! 

. @transition2017 update and policy plans for the first 100 days.. 

I have always had a good relationship with Chuck Schumer.  He is far smarter than Harry R and has the ability to get things done.  Good news! 

General James "Mad Dog" Mattis, who is being considered for Secretary of Defense, was very impressive yesterday.  A true General's General! 

I watched parts of @nbcsnl Saturday Night Live last night.  It is a totally one-sided, biased show - nothing funny at all.  Equal time for us? 

Numerous patriots will be coming to Bedminster today as I continue to fill out the various positions necessary to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The cast and producers of Hamilton, which I hear is highly overrated, should immediately apologize to Mike Pence for their terrible behavior\. 

The Theater must always be a safe and special place. The cast of Hamilton was very rude last night to a very good man, Mike Pence.  Apologize! 

Our wonderful future V. P.  Mike Pence was harassed last night at the theater by the cast of Hamilton, cameras blazing. This should not happen! 

The ONLY bad thing about winning the Presidency is that I did not have the time to go through a long but winning trial on Trump U.  Too bad! 

I settled the Trump University lawsuit for a small fraction of the potential award because as President I have to focus on our country. 

Will be working all weekend in choosing the great men and women who will be helping to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

I worked hard with Bill Ford to keep the Lincoln plant in Kentucky.  I owed it to the great State of Kentucky for their confidence in me! 

Just got a call from my friend Bill Ford, Chairman of Ford, who advised me that he will be keeping the Lincoln plant in Kentucky - no Mexico\. 

My transition team, which is working long hours and doing a fantastic job, will be seeing many great candidates today.  #MAGA\. 

Australia, New Zealand, and more.  I am always available to them.  @nytimes is just upset that they looked like fools in their coverage of me. 

I have recieved and taken calls from many foreign leaders despite what the failing @nytimes said.  Russia, U. K. , China, Saudi Arabia, Japan,

The failing @nytimes story is so totally wrong on transition.  It is going so smoothly.  Also, I have spoken to many foreign leaders. 

I am not trying to get "top level security clearance" for my children.  This was a typically false news story. 

Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions.  I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! 

The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play.  Campaigning is much different! 

If the election were based on total popular vote I would have campaigned in  N. Y.  Florida and California and won even bigger and more easily\. 

The debates, especially the second and third, plus speeches and intensity of the large rallies, plus OUR GREAT SUPPORTERS, gave us the win! 

I will be interviewed on @60Minutes tonight after the NFL game - 7:00 P. M.  Enjoy! 

The @nytimes states today that DJT believes "more countries should acquire nuclear weapons. " How dishonest are they.  I never said this! 

Governor John Kasich of the GREAT, GREAT, GREAT State of Ohio called to congratulate me on the win.  The people of Ohio were incredible! 

Jeb Bush, George W and George H. W.  all called to express their best wishes on the win.  Very nice! 

Mitt Romney called to congratulate me on the win.  Very nice! 

The @nytimes sent a letter to their subscribers apologizing for their BAD coverage of me.  I wonder if it will change - doubt it? 

Wow, the @nytimes is losing thousands of subscribers because of their very poor and highly inaccurate coverage of the "Trump phenomena"

This will prove to be a great time in the lives of ALL Americans.  We will unite and we will win, win, win! 

Today we express our deepest gratitude to all those who have served in our armed forces.  #ThankAVet. 

Busy day planned in New York.  Will soon be making some very important decisions on the people who will be running our government! 

Love the fact that the small groups of protesters last night have passion for our great country.  We will all come together and be proud! 

Just had a very open and successful presidential election.  Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting.  Very unfair! 

A fantastic day in D. C.  Met with President Obama for first time.  Really good meeting, great chemistry.  Melania liked Mrs.  O a lot! 

Happy 241st birthday to the U. S.  Marine Corps!  Thank you for your service!!.

Get rich quick!  Crooked Hillary Clinton's pay to play guide. 

Yet more evidence of a media-rigged election. 

My wife, Melania, will be interviewed tonight at 8:00pm by Anderson Cooper on @CNN.  I have no doubt she will do very well.  Enjoy!

Trump Virginia Office Announces Statewide TV Ad Strategy and Leadership Team. 

Join me in Colorado Springs, Colorado tomorrow at 1:00pm!  #MAGA Tickets. 

Crooked Hillary colluded w/FBI and DOJ and media is covering up to protect her.  It's a #RiggedSystem!  Our country deserves better!. 

New polls are good because the media has deceived the public by putting women front and center with made-up stories and lies, and got caught\. 

"Journalists shower Hillary Clinton with campaign cash". 

"State Department official accused of offering 'quid pro quo' in Clinton email scandal". 

Wow, new polls just came out from @CNN   Great numbers, especially after total media hit job.  Leading Ohio 48 - 44. 

Voter fraud!  Crooked Hillary Clinton even got the questions to a debate, and nobody says a word.  Can you imagine if I got the questions? 

Unbelievable.. 

WikiLeaks proves even the Clinton campaign knew Crooked mishandled classified info, but no one gets charged?  RIGGED!. 

We have all got to come together and win this election.  We can't have four more years of Obama (or worse! ). 

Of course there is large scale voter fraud happening on and before election day.  Why do Republican leaders deny what is going on?  So naive! 

"@RosieGray: Peter Thiel chooses now to give $1. 25mil in support of Trump. 

"@PrisonPlanet: Trump accuser praised him in an email as recently as April!  This is all yet another hoax.    Terrible\. 

"@MarkSimoneNY: Watch Joe Biden's Long History Of Grabbing, Kissing and Groping Women Who Are Cringing. 

Can't believe these totally phoney stories, 100% made up by women (many already proven false) and pushed big time by press, have impact! 

ALL SAFE IN ORANGE COUNTY, NORTH CAROLINA.  With you all the way, will never forget.  Now we have to win.  Proud of you all!   @NCGOP\. 

Animals representing Hillary Clinton and Dems in North Carolina just firebombed our office in Orange County because we are winning @NCGOP\. 

Wow, interview released by Wikileakes shows "quid pro quo" in Crooked Hillary e-mail probe. Such a dishonest person - & Paul Ryan does zilch! 

Finally, in the new ABC News/Washington Post Poll, Hillary Clinton is down 11 points with WOMEN VOTERS and the election is close at 47-43! 

Paul Ryan, a man who doesn't know how to win (including failed run four years ago), must start focusing on the budget, military, vets etc. 

The Democrats have a corrupt political machine pushing crooked Hillary Clinton.  We have Paul Ryan, always fighting the Republican nominee! 

Join me in Wisconsin tomorrow or Colorado on Tuesday! Green Bay- 6pm  Springs- 1pm. 

“The vast majority felt she should be prosecuted... " -- even senior FBI officials thought Crooked was guilty.. 

The election is absolutely being rigged by the dishonest and distorted media pushing Crooked Hillary - but also at many polling places - SAD\. 

We've all wondered how Hillary avoided prosecution for her email scheme.  Wikileaks may have found the answer.  Obama!. 

Hillary's staff thought her email scandal might just blow over.  Who would trust these people with national security?. 

A country that Crooked Hillary says has funded ISIS also gave Wild Bill $1 million for his birthday?  SO CORRUPT!. 

They let Crooked & the Gang off the hook for the crime, but it looks like the cover-up is just as bad.  Unbelievable!. 

Election is being rigged by the media, in a coordinated effort with the Clinton campaign, by putting stories that never happened into news! 

Polls close, but can you believe I lost large numbers of women voters based on made up events THAT NEVER HAPPENED.  Media rigging election! 

Watched Saturday Night Live hit job on me. Time to retire the boring and unfunny show.  Alec Baldwin portrayal stinks.  Media rigging election!

Will be in Bangor, Maine today at 3pm- join me!  #MAGATickets. 

This election is being rigged by the media pushing false and unsubstantiated charges, and outright lies, in order to elect Crooked Hillary! 

100% fabricated and made-up charges, pushed strongly by the media and the Clinton Campaign, may poison the minds of the American Voter.  FIX!

Very little pick-up by the dishonest media of incredible information provided by WikiLeaks.  So dishonest!  Rigged system! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton likes to talk about the things she will do but she has been there for 30 years - why didn't she do them? 

Thank you Florida- a MOVEMENT that has never been seen before and will never be seen again.  Lets get out & #VoteTrumpPence16 on 11/8!  #MAGA.

DON'T LET HER FOOL US AGAIN.. 

Crooked's State Dept gave special attention to "Friends of Bill" after the Haiti Earthquake.  Unbelievable!. 

I hope people are looking at the disgraceful behavior of Hillary Clinton as exposed by WikiLeaks.  She is unfit to run. 

In Texas now, leaving soon for BIG rally in Florida! 

The very foul mouthed Sen.  John McCain begged for my support during his  primary (I gave, he won), then dropped me over locker room remarks! 

Wow.  Unbelievable.. 

Disloyal R's are far more difficult than Crooked Hillary.  They come at you from all sides.  They don’t know how to win - I will teach them! 

With the exception of cheating Bernie out of the nom the Dems have always proven to be far more loyal to each other than the Republicans! 

It is so nice that the shackles have been taken off me and I can now fight for America the way I want to. 

Our very weak and ineffective leader, Paul Ryan, had a bad conference call where his members went wild at his disloyalty. 

Despite winning the second debate in a landslide (every poll), it is hard to do well when Paul Ryan and others give zero support! 

Thank you Pennsylvania.  This is a MOVEMENT like we have never seen before!  #VoteTrumpPence16 on 11/8/16- together, we will #MAGA!. 

Is this really America?  Terrible!. 

Wow, @CNN got caught fixing their "focus group" in order to make Crooked Hillary look better.  Really pathetic and totally dishonest! 

Debate polls look great - thank you! #MAGA #AmericaFirst. 

CNN is the worst - fortunately they have bad ratings because everyone knows they are biased.. 

Paul Ryan should spend more time on balancing the budget, jobs and illegal immigration and not waste his time on fighting Republican nominee\. 

Thank you for all of the great comments on the debate last night.  Very exciting! 

Thank you St.  Louis, Missouri! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.

The so-called Commission on Presidential Debates admitted to us that the DJT audio & sound level was very bad.  So why didn't they fix it? 

I won the debate if you decide without watching the totally one-sided "spin" that followed.  This despite the really bad microphone.

Why isn't Hillary 50 points ahead?  Maybe it's the email scandal, policies that spread ISIS, or calling millions of Americans deplorables!. 

The people are really smart in cancelling subscriptions to the Dallas & Arizona papers & now USA Today will lose readers!  The people get it! 

Remember, don't believe "sources said" by the VERY dishonest media.  If they don't name the sources, the sources don't exist. 

Did Crooked Hillary help disgusting (check out sex tape and past) Alicia M become a U. S.  citizen so she could use her in the debate? 

Using Alicia M in the debate as a paragon of virtue just shows that Crooked Hillary suffers from BAD JUDGEMENT!  Hillary was set up by a con. 

Wow, Crooked Hillary was duped and used by my worst Miss U.  Hillary floated her as an "angel" without checking her past, which is terrible! 

Anytime you see a story about me or my campaign saying "sources said," DO NOT believe it.  There are no sources, they are just made up lies! 

Wow, did you see how badly @CNN (Clinton News Network) is doing in the ratings.  With people like @donlemon, who could expect any more? 

While Hillary profits off the rigged system, I am fighting for you!  Remember the simple phrase: #FollowTheMoney.

I really enjoyed the debate last night. Crooked Hillary says she is going to do so many things. Why hasn't she done them in her last 30 years? 

Great debate poll numbers - I will be on @foxandfriends at 7:00 to discuss.  Enjoy! 

Thank you!  Four new #DebateNight polls with the MOVEMENT winning.  Together, we will MAKE AMERICA SAFE & GREAT AGAIN!.

Philly FOP Chief On Presidential Endorsement: Clinton ‘Blew The Police Off'. 

Hillary Clinton's weakness while she was Secretary of State, has emboldened terrorists all over the world.. cont. 

Once again someone we were told is ok turns out to be a terrorist who wants to destroy our country & its people- how did he get thru system? 

Great job once again by law enforcement!  We are proud of them and should embrace them - without them, we don't have a country!

Terrible attacks in NY, NJ and MN this weekend.  Thinking of victims, their families and all Americans!  We need to be strong! 

Under the leadership of Obama & Clinton, Americans have experienced more attacks at home than victories abroad.  Time to change the playbook! 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY - to the United States Air Force!!. 

I would like to express my warmest regards, best wishes and condolences to all of the families and victims of the horrible bombing in NYC. 

Never met but never liked dopey Robert Gates.  Look at the mess the U. S.  is in.  Always speaks badly of his many bosses, including Obama. 

Heading to Colorado for a big rally.  Massive crowd, great people!  Will be there soon - the polls are looking good. 

My lawyers want to sue the failing @nytimes so badly for irresponsible intent.  I said no (for now), but they are watching.  Really disgusting\. 

The failing @nytimes has gone nuts that Crooked Hillary is doing so badly.  They are willing to say anything, has become a laughingstock rag! 

Crazy Maureen Dowd, the wacky columnist for the failing @nytimes, pretends she knows me well--wrong! 

@nytimesdowd Wacky @NYTimesDowd, who hardly knows me, makes up things that I never said for her boring interviews and column.  A neurotic dope! 

. @CNN just doesn't get it, and that's why their ratings are so low - and getting worse.  Boring anti-Trump panelists, mostly losers in life! 

I never met former Defense Secretary Robert Gates.  He knows nothing about me.  But look at the results under his guidance - a total disaster! 

Crooked Hillary wants to take your 2nd Amendment rights away.  Will guns be taken from her heavily armed Secret Service detail?  Maybe not! 

My thoughts and prayers go out to the @PhillyPolice & @Penn police officers- in Philadelphia.. 

"Donald Trump’s birther event is the greatest trick he’s ever pulled". 

A very interesting take from @KatiePavlich.

#NeverForget. 

The seriously failing @nytimes, despite so much winning and poll numbers that will soon put me in first place, only writes dishonest hits! 

Hillary Clinton just had her 47% moment.  What a terrible thing she said about so many great Americans! 

While Hillary said horrible things about my supporters, and while many of her supporters will never vote for me, I still respect them all! 

Really sad that Republicans would allow themselves to be used in a Clinton ad.  Lindsey Graham, Romney, Flake, Sass.  SUPREME COURT, REMEMBER! 

Wow, Hillary Clinton was SO INSULTING to my supporters, millions of amazing, hard working people.  I think it will cost her at the Polls! 

Will be in Missouri today with Melania for the funeral of a wonderful and truly respected woman, Phyllis S! 

"@Stvzbnk: Just Watched @tonyschwartz.  Obviously Tony is a Total Whack Job @realDonaldTrump"

Just returned from Pensacola, Florida, where the crowd was incredible. 

I havn't seen @tonyschwartz in many years, he hardly knows me.  Never liked his style.  Super lib, Crooked H supporter.  Irrelevant dope! 

Dummy writer @tonyschwartz, who wanted to do a second book with me for years (I said no), is now a hostile basket case who feels jilted! 

Thank you Florida - we are going to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Join us:   #AmericaFirst.

Thank you Ohio.  Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Great honor to be endorsed by popular & successful @gov_gilmore of VA.  A state that I very much want to win-THX Jim!. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou. 

Henry McMaster, Lt.  Governor of South Carolina who endorsed me, beat failed @CNN announcer Bakari Sellers, so badly.  Funny! 

@nbc Jeff Zucker failed @NBC and he is now failing @CNN. 

. @CNN is unwatchable.  Their news on me is fiction.  Theyare a disgrace to the broadcasting industry and an arm of the Clinton campaign. 

The documentary of me that @CNN just aired is a total waste of time.  I don't even know many of the people who spoke about me.  A joke! 

Final poll results from NBC on last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum.  Thank you!  #ImWithYou #MAGA. 

It wasn't Matt Lauer that hurt Hillary last night.  It was her very dumb answer about emails & the veteran who said she should be in jail. 

More poll results from last nights Commander-in-Chief Forum.  #AmericaFirst #TrumpTrain. 

Last nights results - in poll taken by NBC.  #AmericaFirst #ImWithYou. 

With Luis, Mexico and the United States would have made wonderful deals together - where both Mexico and the US would have benefitted. 

Mexico has lost a brilliant finance minister and wonderful man who I know is highly respected by President Peña Nieto. 

Hillary Clinton answered email questions differently last night than she has in the past.  She is totally confused.  Unfit to serve as #POTUS. 

Hillary just gave a disastrous news conference on the tarmac to make up for poor performance last night.  She's being decimated by the media! 

"A rough night for Hillary Clinton"  ABC News. 

Wow, reviews are in - THANK YOU! 

COMING UP @GenFlynn @newtgingrich on @foxandfriends\. 

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the nice reviews of last night.

As a tribute to the late, great Phyllis Schlafly, I hope everybody can go out and get her latest book, THE CONSERVATIVE CASE FOR TRUMP. 

China wouldn't provide a red carpet stairway from Air Force One and then Philippines President calls Obama "the son of a whore. " Terrible! 

The truly great Phyllis Schlafly, who honored me with her strong endorsement for president, has passed away at 92.  She was very special! 

Thank you Ohio!  #AmericaFirst.

"@CherNuna: @realDonaldTrump It defies belief the Web of Lies Hillary is spinning!  One excuse after another.  Then it's this, then it's that. 

Lyin' Hillary Clinton told the FBI that she did not know the "C" markings on documents stood for CLASSIFIED.  How can this be happening? 

To the African-American community: The Democrats have failed you for fifty years, high crime, poor schools, no jobs.  I will fix it, VOTE "T"

The polls are close so Crooked Hillary is getting out of bed and will campaign tomorrow. Why did she hammer 13 devices and acid-wash e-mails? 

The Great State of Arizona, where I just had a massive rally (amazing people), has a very weak and ineffective Senator, Jeff Flake.  Sad! 

The Republican Party needs strong and committed leaders, not weak people such as @JeffFlake, if it is going to stop illegal immigration. 

"@AnneBellar: @realDonaldTrump @CNN CNN is so biased.  Never ever watch them.  Trump 2016!! "

Crooked Hillary's V. P.  pick said this morning that I was not aware that Russia took over Crimea.  A total lie - and taken over during O term! 

Wow, the failing @nytimes has not reported properly on Crooked's FBI release.  They are at the back of the pack - no longer a credible source\. 

. @CNN is so disgusting in their bias, but they are having a hard time promoting Crooked Hillary in light of the new e-mail scandals. 

Great visit to Detroit church, fantastic reception, and all @CNN talks about is a small protest outside.  Inside a large and wonderful crowd!

Now that African-Americans are seeing what a bad job Hillary type policy and management has done to the inner-cities, they want TRUMP! 

Crooked Hillary's brainpower is highly overrated. Probably why her decision making is so bad or, as stated by Bernie S, she has BAD JUDGEMENT\. 

Does anyone know that Crooked Hillary, who tried so hard, was unable to pass the Bar Exams in Washington D. C.  She was forced to go elsewhere\. 

"@PMNOrlando: @realDonaldTrump I know of NO ONE voting for Crooked Hillary!  Her rallies are held in (blank)  & she still has room.

I will be making a major speech on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION on Wednesday in the GREAT State of Arizona.  Big crowds, looking for a larger venue. 

I think that both candidates, Crooked Hillary and myself, should release detailed medical records.  I have no problem in doing so!  Hillary?

How quickly people forget that Crooked Hillary called African-American youth "SUPER PREDATORS" - Has she apologized? 

I am very proud to have brought the subject of illegal immigration back into the discussion.  Such a big problem for our country-I will solve\. 

Wonderful @pastormarkburns was attacked viciously and unfairly on @MSNBC by crazy @morningmika on low ratings @Morning_Joe.  Apologize! 

What do African-Americans and Hispanics have to lose by going with me.  Look at the poverty, crime and educational statistics.  I will fix it!

CLINTON CORRUPTION AND HER SABOTAGE OF THE INNER CITIES.  Full speech transcript. 

Hillary Clinton only knows how to make a speech when it is a hit on me.  No policy, and always very short (stamina).  Media gives her a pass! 

HRC is using the oldest play in the Dem playbook- when their policies fail, they are left w/this one tired argument!. 

Hillary Clinton is using race-baiting to try to get African-American voters- but they know she is all talk and NO ACTION! 

Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society.  She should be ashamed of herself! 

Just watched recap of #CrookedHillary's speech.  Very short and lies.  She is the only one fear-mongering! 

So many in the African-American community are doing so badly, poverty and crime way up, employment and jobs way down: I will fix it, promise\. 

Poll numbers are starting to look very good.  Leading in Florida @CNN Arizona and big jump in Utah.  All numbers rising, national way up.  Wow!

Join me in Tampa, Florida- tomorrow at 1pmE!  Tickets. 

President Obama should have gone to Louisiana days ago, instead of golfing.  Too little, too late! 

Hillary Clinton strongly stated  that there was "absolutely no connection" between her private work and that of The State Department.  LIE! 

It is being reported by virtually everyone, and is a fact,  that the media pile on against me is the worst in American political history! 

I am now in Texas doing a big fundraiser for the Republican Party and a @FoxNews Special on the BORDER and with victims of border crime! 

@washingtonpost The @WashingtonPost quickly put together a hit job book on me- comprised of copies of some of their inaccurate stories.  Don't buy, boring! 

. @AnnCoulter's new book, 'In Trump We Trust, comes out tomorrow.  People are saying it's terrific - knowing Ann I am sure it is! 

Just leaving Akron, Ohio, after a packed rally.  Amazing people!  Going now to Texas. 

Great meeting with active & retired law enforcement officers- at the Fraternal Order of Police lodge in Akron, Ohio..

Crooked Hillary is flooding the airwaves with false and misleading ads - all paid for by her bosses on Wall Street.  Media is protecting her! 

I have been drawing very big and enthusiastic crowds, but the media refuses to show or discuss them.  Something very big is happening!

Just as we won the Cold War, in part, by exposing the evils of communism and the virtues of free markets.... Cont. 

This is my pledge to the American people. 

'It's just a 2-point race, Clinton 38%, Trump 36%'. 

Another health insurer is pulling back due to 'persistent financial losses on #Obamacare plans. ' Only the beginning!.

"CLINTON REFUGEE PLAN COULD BRING IN 620,000 REFUGEES IN FIRST TERM AT LIFETIME COST OF OVER $400 BILLION. ". 

#MakeAmericaSafeAgain. 

Certain Republicans who have lost to me would rather save face by fighting me than see the U. S. Supreme Court get proper appointments.  Sad! 

"Stay on message" is the chant.  I always do - trade, jobs, military, vets, 2nd A, repeal Ocare, borders, etc - but media misrepresents! 

I have always been the same person-remain true to self. The media wants me to change but it would be very dishonest to supporters to do so! 

It is not "freedom of the press" when newspapers and others are allowed to say and write whatever they want even if it is completely false! 

I am not only fighting Crooked Hillary, I am fighting the dishonest and corrupt media and her government protection process.  People get it! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is being protected by the media.  She is not a talented person or politician.  The dishonest media refuses to expose! 

My rallies are not covered properly by the media.  They never discuss the real message and never show crowd size or enthusiasm. 

If the disgusting and corrupt media covered me honestly and didn't put false meaning into the words I say, I would be beating Hillary by 20%

The failing @nytimes, which never spoke to me, keeps saying that I am saying to advisers that I will change.  False, I am who I am-never said\. 

The failing @nytimes talks about anonymous sources and meetings that never happened.  Their reporting is fiction.  The media protects Hillary! 

"@zulu_out: You are a man for the people because you know what it is like to be among the people #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #USA Loves U" Thanks\. 

"@PaulaDuvall2: We're all enjoying you, as well, Mr.  T.!  You've inspired Hope and a Positive Spirit throughout America!  God bless you! " Nice\. 

"@need2knowu:  @willspeakout yes you are my hero I admire you for laying down your glorious luxurious life to get beat up for America!!! "

We now have confirmation as to one reason Crooked H wanted to be sure that nobody saw her e-mails - PAY-FOR-PLAY.  How can she run for Pres. 

"@willspeakout: Thank you for all that you are doing for us!  You campaign endlessly and have spent millions. We love you!  #TrumpTrain" Thanks\. 

I am truly enjoying myself while running for president.  The people of our country are amazing - great numbers on November 8th! 

The failing @nytimes has become a newspaper of fiction.  Their stories about me always quote non-existent unnamed sources.  Very dishonest! 

Will be on @seanhannity tonight at 10pm, hosted by @GovMikeHuckabee.  Enjoy! 

Thank you Erie, Pennsylvania!  Together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!. 

Unbelievable support in Florida last night - thank you!  #MAGA. 

ISIS gained tremendous strength during Hillary Clinton's term as Secretary of State.  When will the dishonest media report the facts! 

I love watching these poor, pathetic people (pundits) on television working so hard and so seriously to try and figure me out.  They can't! 

A massive tax increase will be necessary to fund Crooked Hillary Clinton's agenda.  What a terrible (and boring) rollout that was yesterday! 

"@laurencristmann: Thank you for coming to Pennsylvania today.  I will be there with @C_Lynne_Ryan your 3rd CD delegate at 2 pm"

Ratings challenged @CNN reports so seriously that I call President Obama (and Clinton) "the founder" of ISIS, & MVP.  THEY DON'T GET SARCASM?

This is no surprise.  Constant phony reporting from failing @CNN turns everyone off.  The American people get it!. 

Thank you Fort Lauderdale, Florida.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Great job today by the NYPD in protecting the people and saving the climber.

My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers shot in Sebastian County, Arkansas.  #LESM\. 

Morning Joe's weakness is its low ratings.  I don't watch anymore but I heard he went wild against Rudy Giuliani and #2A - sad & irrelevant! 

. @dbongino  You were fantastic in defending both the Second Amendment and me last night on @CNN.  Don Lemon is a lightweight - dumb as a rock\. 

"@dbongino: ‘Now cut off my mic! ’ Bongino refuses to be bullied by Don Lemon over Trump, 2nd Amendment – HEATED!. 

Media desperate to distract from Clinton's anti-2A stance.  I said pro-2A citizens must organize and get out vote to save our Constitution! 

When is the media going to talk about Hillary's policies that have gotten people killed, like Libya, open borders, and maybe her emails?

Being in Detroit today was wonderful.  Quick stop in Ohio to meet with some of our great supporters.  Just got back home! 

'As Senator Clinton promised 200,000 jobs in Upstate New York - her efforts fell flat. '.

#ICYMI: "Will Media Apologize to Trump? ". 

Michael Morell, the lightweight former Acting Director of C. I. A. , and a man who has made serious bad calls, is a total Clinton flunky! 

The media is going crazy.  They totally distort so many things on purpose.  Crimea, nuclear, "the baby" and so much more.  Very dishonest! 

I see where Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake of Baltimore is pushing Crooked hard.  Look at the job she has done in Baltimore.  She is a joke! 

Thank you Windham, New Hampshire!  #TrumpPence16 #MAGA  – at Windham, NH\. 

@larry_kudlow . @Larry_Kudlow - 'Donald Trump Is the middle-class growth candidate'. 

I am not just running against Crooked Hillary Clinton, I am running against the very dishonest and totally biased media - but I will win! 

#CrookedHillary is not fit to be our next president!  #TrumpPence16. 

Heading to New Hampshire - will be talking about Hillary saying her brain SHORT CIRCUITED, and other things! 

Anybody whose mind "SHORT CIRCUITS" is not fit to be our president!  Look up the word "BRAINWASHED. "

Crooked Hillary said loudly, and for the world to see, that she "SHORT CIRCUITED" when answering a question on her e-mails.  Very dangerous! 

Hillary Clinton is being badly criticized for her poor performance in answering questions.  Let us all see what happens! 

Good luck #TeamUSA#OpeningCeremony #Rio2016.

Hillary Clinton has bad judgment and is unfit to serve as President.. 

The plane I saw on television was the hostage plane in Geneva, Switzerland, not the plane carrying $400 million in cash going to Iran! 

President Obama refuses to answer question about Iran terror funding.   I won't dodge questions as your President.. 

Obama's disastrous judgment gave us ISIS, rise of Iran, and the worst economic numbers since the Great Depression! 

President Obama should ask the DNC about how they rigged the election against Bernie. 

@mike_pence See you tomorrow w/ Gov.  @Mike_Pence, Iowa & Wisconsin!  3pm-.

Our incompetent Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton, was the one who started talks to give 400 million dollars, in cash, to Iran.  Scandal! 

There is great unity in my campaign, perhaps greater than ever before.  I want to thank everyone for your tremendous support.  Beat Crooked H! 

Great day in Virginia.  Crowd was fantastic!

During the GOP convention, CNN cut away from the victims of illegal immigrant violence.  They don’t want them heard.. 

When will CNN do a segment on Hillary’s plan to increase Syrian refugees 550% and how much it will cost? 

Hillary Clinton raked in money from regimes that horribly oppress women and gays & refuses to speak out against Radical Islam. 

Hillary, whose decisions have led to the deaths of many, accepted $ from a business linked to ISIS.  Silence at CNN.. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is 100% owned by her donors.  #ImWithYou #MAGA. 

Thank you Columbus, Ohio!  I will be back soon.  #ImWithYou #MAGA. 

Thank you Oklahoma & Virginia!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou. 

People believe CNN these days almost as little as they believe Hillary.... that's really saying something! 

The people who support Hillary sit behind CNN anchor chairs, or headline fundraisers - those disconnected from real life. 

Will CNN send its cameras to the border to show the massive unreported crisis now unfolding -- or are they worried it will hurt Hillary? 

When will we see stories from CNN on Clinton Foundation corruption and Hillary's pay-for-play at State Department? 

CNN anchors are completely out of touch with everyday people worried about rising crime, failing schools and vanishing jobs. 

CNN will soon be the least trusted name in news if they continue to be the press shop for Hillary Clinton. 

Join Governor Mike Pence in Reno, Nevada- tonight at 7pm!  Tickets available at. 

#CrookedHillary. 

So with all of the Obama tough talk on Russia and the Ukraine, they have already taken Crimea and continue to push.  That's what I said! 

When I said in an interview that Putin is "not going into Ukraine, you can mark it down," I am saying if I am President.  Already in Crimea! 

This story is not about Mr.  Khan, who is all over the place doing interviews, but rather RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM and the U. S.  Get smart! 

Mr.  Khan, who does not know me, viciously attacked me from the stage of the DNC and is now all over T. V.  doing the same - Nice! 

Wow, it is unbelievable how distorted, one-sided and biased the media is against us.  The failing @nytimes is a joke.  @CNN is laughable! 

"@RealJamesWoods:  Without absolutely OWNING the liberal media, HillaryClinton wouldn't stand a chance.  #VoterFraud and #MSM her only hope. "

The dishonest media is fawning over the Democratic Convention.  I wonder why, then, my speech had millions of more viewers than Crooked H? 

I was viciously attacked by Mr.  Khan at the Democratic Convention.  Am I not allowed to respond?  Hillary voted for the Iraq war, not me! 

Captain Khan, killed 12 years ago, was a hero, but this is about RADICAL ISLAMIC TERROR and the weakness of our "leaders" to eradicate it! 

Nielson Media Research final numbers on ACCEPTANCE SPEECH: TRUMP  32. 2 MILLION.   CLINTON 27. 8 MILLION.   Thank you! 

Thank you to all of the television viewers that made my speech at the Republican National Convention #1 over Crooked Hillary and DEMS. 

Can you imagine if I had the small crowds that Hillary is drawing today in Pennsylvania.  It would be a major media event!  @CNN @FoxNews\. 

NATO commander agrees members should pay up via @dcexaminer. 

Wow, NATO's top commander just announced that he agrees with me that alliance members must PAY THEIR BILLS.  This is a general I will like! 

The "Rust Belt" was created by politicians like the Clintons who allowed our jobs to be stolen from us by other countries like Mexico.  END! 

Crooked's stop in Johnstown, Pennsylvania, where jobs have been absolutely decimated by dumb politicians, drew less than 200 - with Bill, VP\. 

#CrookedHillary = Obama's third term, which would be terrible news for our economic growth - seen below.. 

Word is that Crooked Hillary has very small and unenthusiastic crowds in Pennsylvania.  Perhaps it is because her husband signed NAFTA? 

I turned down a meeting with Charles and David Koch.  Much better for them to meet with the puppets of politics, they will do much better! 

Why doesn't the media want to report that on the two "Big Thursdays" when Crooked Hillary and I made our speeches - Republican's won ratings\. 

#CrookedHillary. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is soft on crime, supports open borders, and wants massive tax hikes.  A formula for disaster! 

Violent crime is rising across the United States, yet the DNC convention ignored it.  Crime reduction will be one of my top priorities. 

Just got back from Colorado.  The love and enthusiasm at two rallies was incredible.  Big crowds! 

@mike_pence While I am in OH & PA - you can also join @Mike_Pence in Nevada on Mon! Carson City.

American homeownership rate in Q2 2016 was 62. 9% - lowest rate in 51yrs.  WE will bring back the  'American Dream! '. 

We are suffering through the worst long-term unemployment in the last 70 years.  I want change - Crooked Hillary Clinton does not. 

Hillary can never win over Bernie supporters.  Her foreign wars, NAFTA/TPP support & Wall Street ties are driving away millions of votes. 

Colorado was amazing yesterday!  So much support.  Our tax, trade and energy reforms will bring great jobs to Colorado and the whole country. 

"@patrioticpepe: @realDonaldTrump ONLY TRUMP CAN UNITE AMERICA AND FIX OBAMA'S MISTAKES!!!  #Trump2016.

As usual, Hillary & the Dems are trying to rig the debates so 2 are up against major NFL games.  Same as last time w/ Bernie.  Unacceptable!

What Bernie Sanders really thinks of Crooked Hillary Clinton.. 

I am watching Crooked Hillary speak.  Same old stuff, our country needs change! 

Wow, my campaign is hearing from more and more Bernie supporters that they will NEVER support Crooked Hillary.  She sold them out, V. P.  pick! 

In Hillary Clinton's America - things get worse.  #TrumpPence16. 

The dishonest media didn't mention that Bernie Sanders was very angry looking during Crooked's speech.  He wishes he didn't make that deal! 

Thank you!  Facebook. 

Crooked Hillary said that I "couldn't handle the rough and tumble of a political campaign. " Really,I just beat 16 people and am beating her! 

If Michael Bloomberg ran again for Mayor of New York, he wouldn't get 10% of the vote - they would run him out of town!   #NeverHillary\. 

"Little" Michael Bloomberg, who never had the guts to run for president, knows nothing about me.  His last term as Mayor was a disaster! 

General John Allen, who I never met but spoke against me last night, failed badly in his fight against ISIS.  His record = BAD  #NeverHillary\. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton mentioned me 22 times in her very long and very boring speech.  Many of her statements were lies and fabrications!

Two policemen just shot in San Diego, one dead.  It is only getting worse.  People want LAW AND ORDER! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton made up facts about me, and "forgot" to mention the many problems of our country, in her very average scream! 

The media coverage this morning of the very average Clinton speech and Convention is a joke.  @CNN and the little watched @Morning_Joe = SAD! 

No one has worse judgement than Hillary Clinton - corruption and devastation follows her wherever she goes. 

Hillary's wars in the Middle East have unleashed destruction, terrorism and ISIS across the world. 

Hillary's vision is a borderless world where working people have no power, no jobs, no safety. 

Hillary will never reform Wall Street.  She is owned by Wall Street! 

Our way of life is under threat by Radical Islam and Hillary Clinton cannot even bring herself to say the words. 

Hillary's refusal to mention Radical Islam, as she pushes a 550% increase in refugees, is more proof that she is unfit to lead the country. 

Departing now - thank you Cedar Rapids, Iowa.  This is a MOVEMENT!. 

#CrookedHillary.

Median household income is down for the middle class since Obama took office.  It will only go further down under Clinton. 

A vote for Clinton-Kaine is a vote for TPP, NAFTA, high taxes, radical regulation, and massive influx of refugees. 

AMERICA'S FUTURE. 

Bernie caved!. 

@realDonaldTrump "@LallyRay: Poll: Donald Trump Sees 17-Point Positive Swing in Two Weeks - Breitbart   @realdonaldtrump"  Great!

If Russia or any other country or person has Hillary Clinton's 33,000 illegally deleted emails, perhaps they should share them with the FBI! 

@mike_pence Join our next Vice President, @Mike_Pence in Wisconsin tonight & Michigan Thursday! MI. 

Not one American flag on the massive stage at the Democratic National Convention until people started complaining-then a small one.  Pathetic\. 

Our not very bright Vice President, Joe Biden, just stated that I wanted to "carpet bomb" the enemy.  Sorry Joe, that was Ted Cruz! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to flood our country with Syrian immigrants that we know little or nothing about.  The danger is massive.  NO! 

Hopefully the violent and vicious killing by ISIS of a beloved French priest is causing people to start thinking rationally.  Get tough! 

The Democratic Convention has paid ZERO respect to the great police and law enforcement professionals of our country.  No recognition - SAD! 

Funny how the failing @nytimes is pushing Dems narrative that Russia is working for me because Putin said "Trump is a genius. " America 1st! 

As I have been saying, Crooked Hillary will approve the job killing TPP after the election, despite her statements to the contrary: top adv. 

Just like I have warned from the beginning, Crooked Hillary Clinton will betray you on the TPP.. 

Many of Bernie's supporters have left the arena.  Did Bernie go home and go to sleep? 

I hate to say it, but the Republican Convention was far more interesting (with a much more beautiful set) than the Democratic Convention! 

No matter what Bill Clinton says and no matter how well he says it, the phony media will exclaim it to be incredible.  Highly overrated! 

You have no idea what my strategy on ISIS is, and neither does ISIS (a good thing).  Please get your facts straight - thanks.  @megynkelly\. 

For the record, I have ZERO investments in Russia. 

In order to try and deflect the horror and stupidity of the Wikileakes disaster, the Dems said maybe it is Russia dealing with Trump.  Crazy! 

Dems don't want to talk ISIS b/c Hillary's foreign interventions unleashed ISIS & her refugee plans make it easier for them to come here. 

Bernie's exhausted, he just wants to shut down and go home to bed! 

The invention of email has proven to be a very bad thing for Crooked Hillary in that it has proven her to be both incompetent and a liar! 

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Join us in Toledo, Ohio- tomorrow night at 8pm!  #TrumpPence16 #MAGATickets. 

Join us tomorrow in Scranton, Pennsylvania at 3pm! #TrumpPence16 #MAGA Tickets. 

Pocahontas bombed last night!  Sad to watch. 

Why aren't the Democrats speaking about ISIS, bad trade deals, broken borders, police and law and order.  The Republican Convention was great\. 

Funny, if you listen to @FoxNews, the Democrats did not have a good day.  If you listen to the other two, they are fawning.  What a difference\. 

Bernie Sanders totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.  All of that work, energy and money, and nothing to show for it!  Waste of time. 

Elizabeth Warren, often referred to as Pocahontas, just misrepresented me and spoke glowingly about Crooked Hillary, who she always hated! 

Sad to watch Bernie Sanders abandon his revolution.  We welcome all voters who want to fix our rigged system and bring back our jobs. 

If Cory Booker is the future of the Democratic Party, they have no future!  I know more about Cory than he knows about himself. 

I was at @FoxNews and met Juan Williams in passing.   He asked if he could have pictures taken with me.  I said fine.  He then trashes on air! 

Hard to believe that Bernie Sanders has done such a complete fold.  He got NOTHING for all of the time, energy and money.  The V. P.  a joke! 

While Bernie has totally given up on his fight for the people, we welcome all voters who want a better future for our workers. 

Clinton betrayed Bernie voters.  Kaine supports TPP, is in pocket of Wall Street, and backed Iraq War. 

Thank you OHIO!  #TrumpPence16. 

Thank you Roanoke, Virginia- be back soon!  #TrumpPence16. 

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!  #TrumpPence16. 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Great POLL numbers are coming out all over.  People don't want another four years of Obama, and Crooked Hillary would be even worse.  #MAGA\. 

The State of Florida is so embarrassed by the antics of Crooked Hillary Clinton and Debbie Wasserman Schultz that they will vote for CHANGE! 

Wow, the Republican Convention went so smoothly compared to the Dems total mess.  But fear not, the dishonest media will find a good spinnnn! 

Here we go again with another Clinton scandal, and e-mails yet (can you believe).  Crooked Hillary knew the fix was in, B never had a chance! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew everything that her "servant" was doing at the DNC - they just got caught, that's all!  They laughed at Bernie. 

If Bernie Sanders, after seeing the just released e-mails, continues to look exhausted and done, then his legacy will never be the same. 

Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Hillary was involved in the e-mail scandal because she is the only one with judgement so bad that such a thing could have happened! 

How much BAD JUDGEMENT was on display by the people in DNC in writing those really dumb e-mails, using even religion, against Bernie! 

The new joke in town is that Russia leaked the disastrous DNC e-mails, which should never have been written (stupid), because Putin likes me\. 

Watched Crooked Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine on 60 Minutes.  No way they are going to fix America's problems.  ISIS & all others laughing! 

The ratings for the Republican National Convention were very good, but for the final night, my speech, great.  Thank you! 

The highly neurotic Debbie Wasserman Schultz is angry that, after stealing and cheating her way to a Crooked Hillary victory, she's out! 

The Democrats are in a total meltdown but the biased media will say how great they are doing!  E-mails say the rigged system is alive & well! 

Even though Bernie Sanders has lost his energy and his strength, I don't believe that his supporters will let Crooked Hillary off the hook! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton was not at all loyal to the person in her rigged system that pushed her over the top, DWS.  Too bad Bernie flamed out\. 

If the Republican Convention had blown up with e-mails, resignation of boss and the beat down of a big player.  (Bernie), media would go wild\. 

The @CNN panels are so one sided, almost all against Trump.  @FoxNews is so much better and the ratings are much higher.  Don't watch CNN! 

I always said that Debbie Wasserman Schultz was overrated.  The Dems Convention is cracking up and Bernie is exhausted, no energy left! 

Today proves what I have always known, that @Reince Priebus is the tough one and the smart one, not Debbie Wasserman Shultz (@DWStweets. )

Sorry folks, but Bernie Sanders is exhausted, just can't go on any longer.  He is trying to dismiss the new e-mails and DNC disrespect.  SAD! 

There is no longer a Bernie Sanders "political revolution. " He is turning out to be a weak and somewhat pathetic figure,wants it all to end! 

An analysis showed that Bernie Sanders would have won the Democratic nomination if it were not for the Super Delegates. 

Looks like the Bernie people will fight.  If not, their BLOOD, SWEAT AND TEARS was a total waste of time.  Kaine stands for opposite! 

Wow, President Obama's brother, Malik, just announced that he is voting for me.  Was probably treated badly by president-like everybody else! 

Bernie Sanders started off strong, but with the selection of Kaine for V. P. , is ending really weak.  So much for a movement!  TOTAL DISRESPECT\. 

The Crooked Hillary V. P.  choice is VERY disrespectful to Bernie Sanders and all of his supporters.  Just another case of BAD JUDGEMENT by H! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain#TrumpPence16. 

"@NancyNielsenn: @realDonaldTrump Dinesh D'Sousa Hillary's America.  see it"

"@OliMauritania: @realDonaldTrump Kaine supported the stupidest deal in the history of deals   #HillaryKaine2016"

Thank you to everyone for the wonderful reviews of my speech on Thursday night.  From the heart! 

The Wikileaks e-mail release today was so bad to Sanders that it will make it impossible for him to support her, unless he is a fraud! 

Just saw Crooked Hillary and Tim Kaine together.  ISIS and our other enemies are drooling.  They don't look presidential to me! 

I will bring jobs back and get wages up.  People haven't had a real wage increase in almost twenty years.  Clinton killed jobs! 

Tim Kaine has been praising the Trans Pacific Partnership and has been pushing hard to get it approved.  Job killer! 

Funny that the Democrats would have their convention in Pennsylvania where her husband and her killed so many jobs.  I will bring jobs back! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton has destroyed jobs and manufacturing in Pennsylvania.  Against steelworkers and miners.  Husband signed NAFTA. 

Leaked e-mails of DNC show plans to destroy Bernie Sanders.  Mock his heritage and much more.  On-line from Wikileakes, really vicious.  RIGGED\. 

Pocahontas wanted V. P.  slot so badly but wasn't chosen because she has done nothing in the Senate.  Also, Crooked Hillary hates her! 

Tim Kaine is, and always has been, owned by the banks.  Bernie supporters are outraged, was their last choice.  Bernie fought for nothing! 

The Bernie Sanders supporters are furious with the choice of Tim Kaine, who represents the opposite of what Bernie stands for.  Philly fight? 

"@Theresa_Cali: @realDonaldTrump General Michael Flynn will make a great Secretary of Defense when you become POTUS!  #MakeAmericaSafeAgain"

I highly recommend the just out book - THE FIELD OF FIGHT - by General Michael Flynn.  How to defeat radical Islam. 

Is it the same Kaine that took hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts while Governor of Virginia and didn't get indicted while Bob M did? 

Another attack, this time in Germany.  Many killed.  God bless the people of Munich. 

One of the best produced, including the incredible stage & set, in the history of conventions.  Great unity!  Big T. V.  ratings!  @KarlRove\. 

Thank you Cleveland.  We love you and will be back many times! 

What a great four days in Cleveland.  So proud of the great job done by the RNC and all.  The police and Secret Service were fantastic! 

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!  #RNCinCLE  – at Quicken Loans\. 

FORMAL ACCEPTANCE OF THE NOMINATION!  #TrumpPence16  – at Quicken Loans Arena\. 

You can watch 360 video live from the podium!    #RNCinCLE #TrumpIsWithYou #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\. 

This is a MOVEMENT!  #RNCinCLE. 

Thank you @DonaldJTrumpJr.  Proud of you!  #RNCinCLE #TrumpPence2016. 

Great job @IvankaTrump!  #RNCinCLE. 

Other than a small group of people who have suffered massive and embarrassing losses, the party is VERY united.  Great love in the arena! 

Ted Cruz talks about the Constitution but doesn't say that if the Dems win the Presidency, the new JUSTICES appointed will destroy us all! 

I am soooo proud of my children, Don, Eric and Tiffany - their speeches, under enormous pressure, were incredible.  Ivanka intros me tonight! 

Great job @EricTrump!  Proud of you! #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Arena was packed, totally electric! 

. @mike_pence was fantastic tonight.  Will be a great V. P. 

@mike_pence Our next Vice President of the United States of America, Gov.  @Mike_Pence! #GOPinCLE #GOPConvention#AmericaFirst. 

Wow, Ted Cruz got booed off the stage, didn't honor the pledge!  I saw his speech two hours early but let him speak anyway.  No big deal! 

Great job @EricTrump!  Proud of you!  #AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE. 

Thank you @ScottWalker!  #AmericaFirst#RNCinCLE. 

Thank you to Governor @ScottWalker for such warm support.  Great speech! 

Thank you @IngrahamAngle!  #AmericaFirst. 

#AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE. 

Watching the #GOPConvention#AmericaFirst #RNCinCLE\. 

John Kasich was never asked by me to be V. P.  Just arrived in Cleveland - will be a great two days! 

STATEMENT ON MELANIA SPEECH. 

The media is spending more time doing a forensic analysis of Melania's speech than the FBI spent on Hillary's emails. 

Good news is Melania's speech got more publicity than any in the history of politics especially if you believe that all press is good press! 

In November, I think the people of Ohio will remember that the Republicans picked Cleveland instead of going to another state.  Jobs! 

Bill Hemmer of @FoxNews was very nice in explaining the excitement and energy in the arena.  More than in past years. 

Congratulations to my children, Don and Tiffany, on having done a fantastic job last night.  I am very proud of you! 

Such a great honor to be the Republican Nominee for President of the United States.  I will work hard and never let you down!  AMERICA FIRST! 

The ROLL CALL is beginning at the Republican National Convention.  Very exciting! 

#MakeAmericaWorkAgain#TrumpPence16 #RNCinCLE. 

#MakeAmericaWorkAgain#TrumpPence16 #RNCinCLE. 

"@RoxaneTancredi:  Democrats are coming to TRUMP.  I used to be proud of the dem party.  No more It is crooked and not for the people. "

It was truly an honor to introduce my wife, Melania.  Her speech and demeanor were absolutely incredible.  Very proud!  #GOPConvention\. 

@oreillyfactor Will be on @OreillyFactor tonight at 8:30pm @FoxNews- prior to Melania's speech at the #GOPConvention.  Tune in- she will do great!  #RNCinCLE\. 

#MakeAmericaSafeAgain! #GOPConvention #RNCinCLE. 

Networks other than low ratings @CNN have been very fair and exciting! 

. @CNN is the worst. They go to their dumb, one-sided panels when a podium speaker is for Trump!  VAST MAJORITY want: Make America Great Again! 

Looking forward to being at the convention tonight to watch all of the wonderful speakers including my wife, Melania.  Place looks beautiful! 

Thank you Mahoning County, Ohio!  See you soon!  #MakeAmericaSafeAgain. 

President Obama just had a news conference, but he doesn't have a clue.  Our country is a divided crime scene, and it will only get worse! 

Our country is totally divided and our enemies are watching.  We are not looking good, we are not looking smart, we are not looking tough! 

@mike_pence "@60Minutes: DonaldTrump and his running mate @Mike_Pence to appear on #60Minutes in first joint interview.  CBS. 

I will be on @60Minutes tonight at 7:00 P. M.  with Mike Pence talking about LAW AND ORDER and many other subjects!  Bad times for divided USA! 

We are TRYING to fight ISIS, and now our own people are killing our police.  Our country is divided and out of control.  The world is watching\. 

We grieve for the officers killed in Baton Rouge today.  How many law enforcement and people have to.... 

The ratings at @FoxNews blow away the ratings of @CNN - not even close.  That's because CNN is the Clinton News Network and people don't like\. 

. @FoxNews is much better, and far more truthful, than @CNN, which is all negative.  Guests are stacked for Crooked Hillary!  I don't watch. 

If Goofy Elizabeth Warren, a very weak Senator, didn't lie about her heritage (being Native American) she would be nothing today.  Pick her H\. 

I hope that Crooked Hillary picks Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, as her V. P.  Then we can litigate her fraud! 

It doesn't matter that Crooked Hillary has experience, look at all of the bad decisions she has made.  Bernie said she has bad judgement! 

As the days and weeks go by,  we see what a total mess our country (and world) is in - Crooked Hillary Clinton led Obama into bad decisions! 

We are going to have a great time in Cleveland.  Will lead to special results for our country.  We will Make America Great Again! 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, who may be the least productive Senator in the U. S.  Senate, must prove she is not a fraud.  Without the con it's over\. 

Thank you to Jack Morgan, Tamara Neo, Cheryl Ann Kraft and all of my friends and supporters in Virginia.  GREAT JOB! 

"@TrumpDoonbeg: Great news!  We've been nominated for Ireland's Best Golf Hotel 2016. We would appreciate your vote!. 

Thank you to Chris Cox and Bikers for Trump - Your support has been amazing.  I will never forget.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Thank you!  #TrumpPence16. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is bought and paid for by Wall Street, lobbyists and special interests.  She will sell our country down the tubes! 

Very sad that a person who has made so many mistakes, Crooked Hillary Clinton, can put out such false and vicious ads with her phony money! 

Crooked Hillary, who embarrassed herself and the country with her e-mail lies, has been a DISASTER on foreign policy.  Look what's happening! 

Crooked Hillary is spending big Wall Street money on ads saying I don't have foreign policy experience, yet look what her policies have done\. 

Look forward to introducing Governor Mike Pence (who has done a spectacular job in the great State of Indiana).  My first choice from start! 

Look forward to Governor Mike Pence V. P.  introduction tomorrow in New York City. 

I am pleased to announce that I have chosen Governor Mike Pence as my Vice Presidential running mate.  News conference tomorrow at 11:00 A. M. 

Four more years of weakness with a Crooked Hillary Administration is not acceptable.  Look what has happened to the world with O & Hillary! 

#NeverTrump is never more.  They were crushed last night in Cleveland at Rules Committee by a vote of 87-12.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

My prayers and condolences to the victims and families of the terrible tragedy in Nice, France.  We are with you in every way! 

In light of the horrible attack in Nice, France, I have postponed tomorrow's news conference concerning my Vice Presidential announcement. 

Another horrific attack, this time in Nice, France.  Many dead and injured.  When will we learn?  It is only getting worse. 

I employ many people in the State of Virginia - JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!  Crooked Hillary will sell us out, just like her husband did with NAFTA. 

Another new poll.  Thank you for your support!  Join the MOVEMENT today!  #ImWithYou. 

Great new poll- thank you America! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou. 

I will be making the announcement of my Vice Presidential pick on Friday at 11am in Manhattan.  Details to follow. 

If I win the Presidency, we will swamp Justice Ginsburg with real judges and real legal opinions! 

@washingtonpost @nytimes Even the @NYTimes and @WashingtonPost Editorial Boards condemned Justice Ginsburg for her ethical and legal breach.  What was she thinking? 

Is Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg going to apologize to me for her misconduct?  Big mistake by an incompetent judge! 

On my way to San Diego to raise money for the Republican Party.  I am spending a lot myself and also helping others. 

Voters understand that Crooked Hillary's negative ads are not true- just like her email lies and her other fraudulent activity. 

Despite spending $500k a day on TV ads alone #CrookedHillary falls flat in nationwide @QuinnipiacPoll.  Having ZERO impact.  Sad!! 

Lyin' Crooked Hillary's email stories all have one thing in common.. 

Is President Obama trying to destroy Israel with all his bad moves?  Think about it and let me know! 

The Republican platform is most pro-Israel of all time! 

New GOP platform now includes language that supports the border wall.  We will build the wall and MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN! 

#CrookedHillary is outspending me by a combined 31 to 1 in Florida, Ohio, & Pennsylvania.  I haven't started yet!. 

Thank you Florida, Ohio, and Pennsylvania!  #CrookedHillary is not qualified.  #ImWithYou. 

Thank you!  #ImWithYou. 

Justice Ginsburg of the U. S.  Supreme Court has embarrassed all by making very dumb political statements about me.  Her mind is shot - resign! 

THANK YOU INDIANA!  #Trump2016. 

Thank you Iowa- see you soon! #Trump2016 #ImWithYou. 

I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 8pm.  Enjoy! 

The American people agree.  No free pass for #CrookedHillary!. 

To all the Bernie voters who want to stop bad trade deals & global special interests, we welcome you with open arms.  People first. 

Bernie sanders has abandoned his supporters by endorsing pro-war pro-TPP pro-Wall Street Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

Bernie Sanders endorsing Crooked Hillary Clinton is like Occupy Wall Street endorsing Goldman Sachs. 

#CrookedHillary is not qualified!. 

I am somewhat surprised that Bernie Sanders was not true to himself and his supporters.  They are not happy that he is selling out! 

Bernie Sanders, who has lost most of his leverage, has totally sold out to Crooked Hillary Clinton.  He will endorse her today - fans angry! 

This election is a choice between law, order & safety - or chaos, crime & violence.  I will make America safe again for everyone.  #ImWithYou\. 

For too many years, our inner cities have been left behind.  I am going to deliver jobs, safety and protection for those in need. 

Crime is out of control, and rapidly getting worse.  Look what is going on in Chicago and our inner cities.  Not good! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #ImWithYou. 

Senior United States District Judge Robert E.  Payne today ruled in favor of Trump campaign delegates who had argued... 

Speech on Veterans' Reform. 

Great poll- Florida!  Thank you!. 

Thoughts and prayers with the victims, and their families- along with everyone at the Berrien County Courthouse in St.  Joseph, Michigan. 

Join me in Westfield, Indiana- tomorrow night at 7:30pm!  #Trump2016 Tickets. 

I heard that the underachieving John King of @CNN on Inside Politics was one hour of lies.  Happily, few people are watching - dead network! 

The media is so dishonest.  If I make a statement, they twist it and turn it to make it sound bad or foolish. They think the public is stupid! 

President Obama thinks the nation is not as divided as people think.  He is living in a world of the make believe! 

Look what is happening to our country under the WEAK leadership of Obama and people like Crooked Hillary Clinton.  We are a divided nation! 

New poll - thank you!  #Trump2016. 

Way to go @serenawilliams  - you are a true champion.  Proud of you! 

MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!. 

Isn't it sad that on a day of national tragedy Hillary Clinton is answering softball questions about her email lies on @CNN? 

Due to the horrific events taking place in our country, I have decided to postpone my speech on economic opportunity- today in Miami. 

Last night's horrific execution-style shootings of 12 Dallas law enforcement officers.... 

Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country\. 

After today, Crooked Hillary can officially be called Lyin' Crooked Hillary. 

Thank you Speaker @PRyan! #AmericaFirst #Trump2016. 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Thank you Rep.  Collins!  #Trump2016. 

Just leaving D. C.  Had great meetings with Republicans in the House and Senate.  Very interesting day!  These are people who love our country! 

Great being in Cincinnati, Ohio last night- thank you!  Off to Washington D. C.  now.  #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst. 

Where is the outrage for this Disney book?  Is this the 'Star of David' also?  Dishonest media!  #Frozen. 

To all of my twitter followers, please contribute whatever you can to the campaign.  We must beat Crooked Hillary.. 

Convention speaker schedule to be released tomorrow.  Let today be devoted to Crooked Hillary and the rigged system under which we live. 

I have over seven million hits on social media re Crooked Hillary Clinton.  Check it out Sleepy Eyes, @MarkHalperin @NBCPolitics\. 

Sleepy eyes Chuck Todd, a man with so little touch for politics, is at it again. He could not have watched my standing ovation speech in N. C. 

Even the once great Caesars is bankrupt in A. C.  Others to follow.  Ask the Democrat City Council what happened to Atlantic City. 

Hillary Clinton should ask why the Democrat pols in Atlantic City made all the wrong moves - Convention Center, Airport - and destroyed City\. 

I made a lot of money in Atlantic City and left 7 years ago, great timing (as all know).  Pols made big mistakes, now many bankruptcies. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton lied to the FBI and to the people of our country.  She is sooooo guilty.  But watch, her time will come! 

The rigged system may have helped Hillary Clinton escape criminal charges, but.... 

Crooked Hillary has once again been proven to be a person who is dishonest, incompetent and of very bad judgement. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton and her team "were extremely careless in their handling of very sensitive, highly classified information. " Not fit! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is unfit to serve as President of the U. S.  Her temperament is weak and her opponents are strong.  BAD JUDGEMENT! 

I don't think the voters will forget the rigged system that allowed Crooked Hillary to get away with "murder. " Come November 8, she's out! 

Raised a lot of money for the Republican Party.  There will be a big gasp when the figures are announced in the morning.  Lots of support!  Win\. 

I will be interviewed by @oreillyfactor tonight on @FoxNews at 11pm.  Enjoy! 

@seanhannity My son, @EricTrump will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on @FoxNews.  Enjoy! 

Looking forward to meeting with @SenBobCorker in a little while.  We will be traveling to North Carolina together today. 

FBI director said Crooked Hillary compromised our national security.  No charges.  Wow!  #RiggedSystem\. 

The system is rigged.  General Petraeus got in trouble for far less.  Very very unfair!  As usual, bad judgment. 

It was great spending time with @joniernst yesterday.  She has done a fantastic job for the people of Iowa and U. S.  Will see her again! 

Taxpayers are paying a fortune for the use of Air Force One on the campaign trail by President Obama and Crooked Hillary.  A total disgrace! 

On @FoxNews at 7:00 P. M.  "Special: Meet the Trumps" Hope you enjoy! 

Why is President Obama allowed to use Air Force One on the campaign trail with Crooked Hillary?  She is flying with him tomorrow.  Who pays? 

With Hillary and Obama, the terrorist attacks will only get worse.  Politically correct fools, won't even call it what it is - RADICAL ISLAM! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is "guilty as hell" but the system is totally rigged and corrupt!  Where are the 33,000 missing e-mails? 

The only people who are not interested in being the V. P.  pick are the people who have not been asked! 

I look forward to meeting @joniernst today in New Jersey.  She has done a great job as Senator of Iowa! 

Spent time with Indiana Governor Mike Pence and family yesterday.  Very impressed, great people! 

Senator Tom Cotton was great on Meet the Press yesterday.  Despite a totally one-sided interview by Chuck Todd, the end result was solid! 

Dishonest media is trying their absolute best to depict a star in a tweet as the Star of David rather than a Sheriff's Star, or plain star! 

Happy 4th of July!  #Trump2016 #AmericaFirst. 

Crooked Hillary will NEVER be able to handle the complexities and danger of ISIS - it will just go on forever.  We need change! 

The third mass attack (slaughter) in days by ISIS.  200 dead in Baghdad, worst in many years.  We do not have leadership that can stop this! 

In Bangladesh, hostages were immediately killed by ISIS terrorists if they were unable to cite a verse from the Koran.  20 were killed! 

I believe that Crooked Hillary sent Bill to have the meeting with the U. S. A. G.  So Bill is not in trouble with H except that he got caught! 

The SECRET meeting between Bill Clinton and the U. S. A. G.  in back of closed plane was heightened with FBI shouting "go away, no pictures. "

Does anybody really believe that Bill Clinton and the U. S. A. G.  talked only about "grandkids" and golf for 37 minutes in plane on tarmac? 

"THE SYSTEM IS RIGGED! "

On Saturday a great man, Elie Wiesel, passed away. The world is a better place because of him and his belief that good can triumph over evil! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton knew that her husband wanted to meet with the U. S. A. G.  to work out a deal.  The system is totally rigged & corrupt! 

Only a fool would believe that the meeting between Bill Clinton and the U. S. A. G.  was not arranged or that Crooked Hillary did not know. 

@MeetThePress Just watched @meetthepress and how totally biased against me Chuck Todd, and the entire show, is against me. The good news-the people get it! 

It was just announced-by sources-that no charges will be brought against Crooked Hillary Clinton.  Like I said, the system is totally rigged! 

It is impossible for the FBI not to recommend criminal charges against Hillary Clinton.  What she did was wrong!  What Bill did was stupid! 

Thank you @greta.  #ImWithYou. 

Thank you for your support! #AmericaFirst #LeadRight2016. 

Thank you!  #AmericaFirst. 

If I become the next POTUS- they will not be ignoring!  #AmericaFirst. 

Crooked Hillary -- Makes History!  #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst. 

The #2A to our Constitution is clear.  The right of the people to keep & bear Arms shall not be infringed upon.. 

#AmericaFirst #ImWithYou. 

The speakers slots at the Republican Convention are totally filled, with a long waiting list of those that want to speak - Wednesday release\. 

Just read in the failing @nytimes that I was not aware "the event had to be held in Cleveland" - a total lie.  These people are sick! 

When you can't say it - or see it -- you can't fix it.  We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AGAIN!  #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst. 

Just returned from Colorado.  Amazing crowd! 

Thank you for inviting me to the Western Conservative Summit in Colorado!  #ImWithYou #WCS16. 

Thank you for your support!  We will MAKE AMERICA SAFE AND GREAT AGAIN!  #ImWithYou #AmericaFirst. 

These crimes won't be happening if I'm elected POTUS.  Killer should have never been here.  #AmericaFirst. 

Yet another terrorist attack today in Israel -- a father, shot at by a Palestinian terrorist, was killed while. 

Horrible killing of a 13 year old American girl at her home in Israel by a Palestinian terrorist.  We must get tough.. 

. @TraceAdkins great job on FOX this morning.  Keep up the good work! 

Take a look at what happened w/ Bill Clinton.  The system is totally rigged.  Does anybody really believe that meeting was just a coincidence? 

Bill Clinton's meeting was a total secret.  Nobody was to know about it but he was caught by a local reporter. 

As Bernie Sanders said, Hillary Clinton has bad judgement.  Bill's meeting was probably initiated and demanded by Hillary! 

#ThrowbackThursday #Trump2016. 

@seanhannity I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm on FOX!  Enjoy! 

The reason I put up approximately $50 million for my successful primary campaign is very simple, I want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

I have self funded my winning primary campaign with an approx.  $50 million loan.  I have totally terminated the loan! 

The very dishonest @NBCNews refuses to accept the fact that I have forgiven my $50 million loan to my campaign.  Done deal! 

One of the reasons Hillary hid her emails was so the public wouldn't see how she got rich- selling out America.. 

Why would college graduates want Crooked Hillary as their President?  She will destroy them!. 

New book by @ericbolling is absolutely terrific and a must read!  #WakeUpAmerica\. 

The story with Hillary will never change.. 

For reasons only they can explain, the @USChamber wants to continue our bad trade deals rather than renegotiating and making them better. 

Tremendous day in Massachusetts and Maine.  Thank you to everyone for making it so special! 

"@Gengm7: @jakeda @realDonaldTrump As of April this year, Hillary had spent $264,000,000 on her campaign Mr. Trump $55,000,000.  self funding"

I will be on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P. M.  Enjoy! 

ISIS exploded on Hillary Clinton's watch- she's done nothing about it and never will.  Not capable! 

Will be in Bangor, Maine today!  Join me- 4pmE at the Cross Insurance Center!. 

New Q poll out- we are going to win the whole deal- and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #Trump2016. 

Just watched Senator John Barrasso on @FoxNews - He was great!  Thank you John. 

Why would the USChamber be upset by the fact that I want to negotiate better and stronger trade deals or that I want penalties for cheaters? 

@USChamber The @USCHAMBER must fight harder for the American worker.  China, and many others, are taking advantage of U. S.  with our terrible trade pacts\. 

Iron Mike Tyson was not asked to speak at the Convention though I'm sure he would do a good job if he was.  The media makes everything up! 

"@jtsbk:  @AllenWest thanks for sharing Eric we need @realDonaldTrump now as this administration is incapable of keeping our country safe"

We must do everything possible to keep this horrible terrorism outside the United States. 

Yet another terrorist attack, this time in Turkey.  Willthe world ever realize what is going on?  So sad. 

Hillary Clinton’s Presidency would be catastrophic forthe future of our country.  She is ill-fit with bad judgment. 

Benghazi is just another Hillary Clinton failure.  It justnever seems to work the way it's supposed to with Clinton.

. @CNN is all negative when it comes to me.  I don't watch it anymore. 

The media is unrelenting.  They will only go with and report a story in a negative light.  I called Brexit (Hillary was wrong), watch November\. 

Crooked Hillary is wheeling out one of the least productive senators in the U. S.  Senate, goofy Elizabeth Warren, who lied on heritage.

The "dirty" poll done by @ABC @washingtonpost is a disgrace.  Even they admit that many more Democrats were polled.  Other polls were good. 

Crooked Hillary Attacks Foreign Government Donations - While Ignoring Her Own. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton got Brexit wrong.  I said LEAVE will win.  She has no sense of markets and such bad judgement.  Only a question of time\. 

Hillary Clinton is not a change agent, just the same old status quo!  She is spending a fortune, I am spending very little.  Close in polls! 

People in our country want borders, and without them the old line pols like Crooked Hillary will not win.  It is time for CHANGE -- and JOBS! 

Top 50 Facts About Crooked Hillary Clinton From Trump 'Stakes Of The Election' Address. 

The @ABC poll sample is heavy on Democrats.   Very dishonest - why would they do that?  Other polls good! 

Crooked Hillary just took a major ad of me playing golf at Turnberry.  Shows me hitting shot, but I never did = lie!  Was there to support son\. 

Clinton is trying to wash away her bad judgement call on BREXIT with big dollar ads.  Disgraceful! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton, who called BREXIT 100% wrong (along with Obama), is now spending Wall Street money on an ad on my correct call. 

George Will, one of the most overrated political pundits (who lost his way long ago), has left the Republican Party. He's made many bad calls\. 

Just landed in New York - a one night stay in Scotland.  Turnberry came out magnificently.  My son, Eric, did a great job - under budget! 

Obama has blocked ICE officers and BP from doing their jobs.  That ends when I am President! 

I have never liked the media term 'mass deportation' -- but we must enforce the laws of the land! 

We only want to admit those who love our people and support our values.  #AmericaFirst\. 

We must suspend immigration from regions linked with terrorism until a proven vetting method is in place. 

Thank you to everyone who came out & joined us @TrumpTurnberry yesterday!  @EricTrump @IvankaTrump @DonaldJTrumpJr.

So funny, Crooked Hillary called BREXIT so incorrectly, and now she says that she is the one to deal with the U. K.  All talk, no action! 

Thoughts and prayers are with everyone in West Virginia- dealing with the devastating floods.  #ImWithYou\. 

"@Jolena3: @realDonaldTrump And we will get it back once we have President Trump!  Can't wait! "

"@DarrenWaggener: @realDonaldTrump What has happened in the UK in the last 12 hours is exactly what will happen in November.. vote TRUMP 2016\. 

Many people are equating BREXIT, and what is going on in Great Britain, with what is happening in the U. S.  People want their country back! 

The opening of Trump Turnberry in Scotland was a big success.  Good timing, I was here for BREXIT.  Very exciting news conference today! 

Crooked Hillary called it totally wrong on BREXIT - she went with Obama - and now she is saying we need her to lead.  She would be a disaster\. 

I want all Americans to succeed together.  President Obama's illegal executive amnesty undermines job prospects for.... 

New Government data by the Center for Immigration Studies shows more than 3M new legal & illegal immigrants settled... 

America is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder w/a free & ind UK.  We stand together as friends, as allies, & as a people w/a shared history. 

Self-determination is the sacred right of all free people's, and the people of the UK have exercised that right for all the world to see. 

Getting ready to open the magnificent Turnberry in Scotland.  What a great day, especially when added to the brave & brilliant vote. 

Statement Regarding British Referendum on E. U.  Membership. 

Just arrived in Scotland.  Place is going wild over the vote.  They took their country back, just like we will take America back.  No games! 

Congratulations to my son, Eric, on the fantastic job he has done in rebuilding Turnberry, and its great Ailsa Course.  Always support kids! 

Leaving now for a one night trip to Scotland in order to be at the Grand Opening of my great Turnberry Resort.  Will be back on Sat.  night! 

Meet the amazing mother whose letter I read during my speech.  She lost her son to policies supported by Clinton.. 

Read my full statement here on the Supreme Court's executive amnesty decision #imwithyou. 

Here is another CNN lie.  The Clinton News Network is losing all credibility.  I’m not watching it much anymore.. 

CNN, which is totally biased in favor of Clinton, should apologize.  They knew they were wrong.. 

Our inner cities have been left behind.  We will never have the resources to support our people if we have an open border. 

On immigration, I’m consulting with our immigration officers& our wage-earners.  Hillary Clinton is consulting with Wall Street. 

Obama & Clinton should stop meeting with special interests, & start meeting with the victims of illegal immigration. 

Hillary Clinton’s open borders are tearing American families apart.  I am going to make our country Safe Again for all Americans.  #Imwithyou\. 

SC has kept us safe from exec amnesty--for now.  But Hillary has pledged to expand it, taking jobs from Hispanic & African-American workers.

#Imwithyou. 

#Imwithyou. 

Hillary says things can't change.  I say they have to change.  It's a choice between Americanism and her corrupt globalism.  #Imwithyou\. 

"@chrisboydbrew: @LouDobbs @realDonaldTrump @FoxBusiness..  Saw your interview. You are the best!  Great questions, great answers" Lou is great\. 

Crooked Hillary refuses to say that she will be raising taxes beyond belief!  She will be a disaster for jobs and the economy! 

I will be interviewed by @LouDobbs tonight on @FoxBusiness 7pm ET\. 

Hillary defrauded America as Secy of State.  She used it as a personal hedge fund to get herself rich!  Corrupt, dangerous, dishonest. 

If you want to know about Hillary Clinton's honesty & judgment, ask the family of Ambassador Stevens. 

Hillary took money and did favors for regimes that enslave women and murder gays. 

I am "the king of debt. "That has been great for me as a businessman, but is bad for the country.  I made a fortune off of debt, will fix U. S. 

Obama-Clinton inherited $10T in debt and turned it into nearly $20T.   They have bankrupted…. 

Hillary Clinton's open borders immigration policies will drive down wages for all Americans - and make everyone less safe. 

How can Hillary run the economy when she can't even send emails without putting entire nation at risk? 

Hillary Clinton surged the trade deficit with China 40% asSecretary of State, costing Americans millions of jobs. 

Hillary says this election is about judgment.   She's right.   Her judgement has killed thousands, unleashed ISIS and wrecked the economy. 

I will be making a big speech tomorrow to discuss the failed policies and bad judgment of Crooked Hillary Clinton. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is totally unfit to be our president-really bad judgement and a temperament, according to new book, which is a mess! 

When I said that if, within the Orlando club, you had some people with guns, I was obviously talking about additional guards or employees\.

Crooked Hillary says we must call on Saudi Arabia and other countries to stop funding hate.  I am calling on- cont'd. 

Saudi Arabia and many of the countries that gave vast amounts of money to the Clinton Foundation- cont'd. 

I thought people weren’t celebrating?  They were cheering all over, even this savage from Orlando.  I was right.. 

In my speech on protecting America I spoke about a temporary ban, which includes suspending immigration from nations tied to Islamic terror. 

Based on the incredibly inaccurate coverage and reporting of the record setting Trump campaign, we are hereby. 

I am no fan of President Obama, but to show you how dishonest the phony Washington Post is. 

TERRORISM, IMMIGRATION, AND NATIONAL SECURITY SPEECH- TRANSCRIPT:    – at Saint Anselm College\. 

@penguins Congratulations to the 2016 #StanleyCup Champions, Pittsburgh @Penguins! 

I am watching @FoxNews and how fairly they are treating me and my words, and @CNN, and the total distortion of my words and what I am saying\. 

I will be going to New Hampshire today, home of my first primary victory, to discuss terror and the horrible events of yesterday.  2:30 P. M. 

I have been hitting Obama and Crooked Hillary hard on not using the term Radical Islamic Terror.  Hillary just broke-said she would now use! 

What has happened in Orlando is just the beginning.  Our leadership is weak and ineffective.  I called it and asked for the ban.  Must be tough\. 

"@WandaWalls20: @realDonaldTrump Please make us safe.  We cannot have Hillary as president.  We will be in so much trouble. 

Reporting that Orlando killer shouted "Allah hu Akbar! " as he slaughtered clubgoers.  2nd man arrested in LA with rifles near Gay parade. 

Is President Obama going to finally mention the words radical Islamic terrorism?  If he doesn't he should immediately resign in disgrace! 

Appreciate the congrats for being right on radical Islamic terrorism, I don't want congrats, I want toughness & vigilance.  We must be smart! 

Horrific incident in FL.  Praying for all the victims & their families.  When will this stop?  When will we get tough, smart & vigilant? 

Clinton made a false ad about me where I was imitating a reporter GROVELING after he changed his story.  I would NEVER mock disabled.  Shame! 

Really bad shooting in Orlando.  Police investigating possible terrorism.  Many people dead and wounded. 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes referred to as Pocahontas, pretended to be a Native American in order to advance her career.  Very racist!

Obama just endorsed Crooked Hillary.  He wants four more years of Obama—but nobody else does! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton will be a disaster on jobs, the economy, trade, healthcare, the military, guns and just about all else.  Obama plus! 

As expected, the media is very much against me.  Their dishonesty is amazing but, just like our big wins in the primaries, we will win! 

"@KathyCeurter: @realDonaldTrump please Mr. Trump make @SenatorJeffSessions your VP.  He is a perfect running mate. "  He is a great guy!

Remembering the fallen heroes on #DDay - June 6, 1944.. 

I am getting bad marks from certain pundits because I have a small campaign staff.  But small is good, flexible, save money and number one! 

A massive blow to Obama's message - only 38,000 new jobs for month in just issued jobs report.  That's REALLY bad! 

Crooked Hillary is being badly criticized (for a Wall Street paid for ad) by PolitiFact for a false ad on me on women.  She is a total fraud! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton has not held a news conference in more than 7 months.  Her record is so bad she is unable to answer tough questions! 

Just like I have been able to spend far less money than  others on the campaign and finish #1, so too should our country.  We can be great! 

People like @KatyTurNBC report on my campaign, but have zero access.  They say what they want without any knowledge. True of so much of media! 

Hillary Clinton is unfit to be president.  She has bad judgement, poor leadership skills and a very bad and destructive track record.  Change! 

I am watching @CNN very little lately because they are so biased against me.  Shows are predictable garbage!  CNN and MSM is one big lie!

Crooked Hillary Clinton, who I would love to call Lyin' Hillary, is getting ready to totally misrepresent my foreign policy positions. 

After the litigation is disposed of and the case won, I have instructed my execs to open Trump U(? ), so much interest in it!  I will be pres.

I am getting great credit for my press conference today.  Crooked Hillary should be admonished for not having a press conference in 179 days. 

Katie Couric, the third rate reporter, who has been largely forgotten, should be ashamed of herself for the fraudulent editing of her doc. 

I will be interviewed on @seanhannity tonight at 10pmE on @FoxNews.  Enjoy!

So many veterans groups are beyond happy with all of the money I raised/gave!  It was my great honor - they do an amazing job. 

Just finished a press conference in Trump Tower wherein I gave information on which VETERANS groups got the $5,600,000 that I raised/gave! 

I have raised/given a tremendous amount of money to our great VETERANS, and have got nothing but bad publicity for doing so.  Watch! 

So many great things happening - new poll numbers looking good!  News conference at 11:00 A. M.  today, Trump Tower! 

I should have easily won the Trump University case on summary judgement but have a judge, Gonzalo Curiel, who is totally biased against me. 

I have a judge in the Trump University civil case, Gonzalo Curiel (San Diego), who is very unfair.  An Obama pick.  Totally biased-hates Trump\. 

I hope everyone had a great Memorial Day! 

I would have had millions of votes more in the primaries (than Crooked Hillary) if I only had one opponent, instead of sixteen.  Broke record\. 

Have a great Memorial Day and remember that we will soon MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

"@NBCDFW: Trump rallies veterans at annual Rolling Thunder Gathering. 

"@FrankyLamouche: how many of donald's rolling thunder brigade will sign up and go to war for him in the middle east. "

"@MariaErnandez3b: Trump Supports Rolling Thunder Rally #TRUMP STRONG   So true, and remember the M. I. A. 's! 

"@ScottWRasmussen: Donald Trump and Bikers Share Affection at Rolling Thunder Rally   A great day in D. C.! 

"@TeaPartyNevada: #Trump2016 "Illegals are taken care of better than our veterans. ". 

The endorsement of me by the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents was the first time that they ever endorsed a presidential candidate.  Nice! 

In getting the endorsement of the 16,500 Border Patrol Agents (thank you), the statement was made that the WALL was very necessary! 

Obama says a WALL at our southern border won't enhance our security (wrong) and yet he now wants to build a much bigger wall (fence) at W. H. 

If dummy Bill Kristol actually does get a spoiler to run as an Independent, say good bye to the Supreme Court! 

The Republican Party has to be smart & strong if it wants to win in November.  Can't allow lightweights to set up a spoiler Indie candidate! 

Bill Kristol has been wrong for 2yrs-an embarrassed loser, but if the GOP can't control their own, then they are not a party.  Be tough, R's! 

Good news is that my campaign has perhaps more cash than any campaign in the history of politics- b/c I stand 100% behind everything we do. 

Heading to D. C.  to see and hear ROLLING THUNDER.  Amazing people that LOVE OUR COUNTRY.  Great spirit! 

Honor Memorial Day by thinking of and respecting all of the great men and women that gave their lives for us and our country!  We love them. 

Does President Obama ever discuss the sneak attack on Pearl Harbor while he's in Japan?  Thousands of American lives lost.  #MDW\. 

Don't believe the biased and phony media quoting people who work for my campaign.  The only quote that matters is a quote from me! 

I am always on the front page of the failing @nytimes, but when I won the GOP nomination, I'm in the back of the paper.  Very dishonest! 

The media is on a new phony kick about my management style.  I spend much less money & get much better results!  What we need as Prez! 

The failing @nytimes wrote a story about my management style & that I don't have many people.  I have 73, Hillary has 800- & I'm beating her. 

I (we) broke the all-time record for most votes gotten in a Republican Primary - by a lot - and with many states left to go!  Thank you. 

The U. S.  has 69 treaties with other countries where we would have to defend them and their borders.  How nice, but what do we get?  NOT ENOUGH\. 

Great rally in Fresno, California- great crowd!  Thank you!  #Trump2016.

Thank you Anaheim, California! #Trump2016. 

Thank you Washington!  Honored to say, on behalf of our great movement, we have broken the all time record for votes in GOP primary history. 

The protesters in New Mexico were thugs who were flying the Mexican flag.  The rally inside was big and beautiful, but outside, criminals! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton just can't close the deal with Bernie.  I had to knock out 16 very good and smart candidates.  Hillary doesn't have it\. 

Goofy Senator Elizabeth Warren @elizabethforma has done less in the U. S.  Senate than practically any other senator.  All talk, no action! 

@elizabethforma  Goofy Elizabeth Warren, sometimes known as Pocahontas, bought foreclosed housing and made a quick killing.  Total hypocrite!

After raising, w/ no obligation, almost $6M for Vets, I couldn't believe protesters formed @ Trump Tower.  JUST OUT- SENT BY CROOKED HILLARY! 

@nytimes Thank you @DailyMail- for setting the failing @NYTimes story straight.  This is what the NYT's should have written!. 

A suggestion for the dishonest media-. 

A wonderfully written article concerning Israel by @JasonDovEsq. 

A great new book has been written about Crooked Hillary.  Read it & you will never be able to vote for her.  @Ed_Klein. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton overregulates, overtaxes and doesn't care about jobs.  Most importantly, she suffers from plain old bad judgement! 

I just released my financial disclosure forms, the largest numbers in the history of the F. E. C.  Even the dishonest media thinks great! 

Amazingly, with all of the money I have raised for the vets, I have got nothing but bad publicity from the dishonest and disgusting media. 

Much of the money I have raised for our veterans has already been distributed, with the rest to go shortly to various other veteran groups. 

While under no obligation to do so, I have raised between 5 & 6 million dollars, including 1million dollars from me, for our VETERANS.  Nice! 

Join me in California or Montana! 5/25/16: Anaheim, California  Billings, Montana. 

I will be interviewed on @oreillyfactor at 8:00 P. M.  Enjoy! 

Obama’s VA Secretary just said we shouldn't measurewait times.  Hillary says VA problems are not ‘widespread. ’ I will take care ofour vets! 

Is Hillary really protecting women?. 

In trade, military and EVERYTHING else, it will be AMERICA FIRST!  This will quickly lead to our ultimate goal: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Thank you America!  #Trump2016. 

The American people are sick and tired of not being able to lead normal lives and to constantly be on the lookout for terror and terrorists! 

Bernie Sanders is continuing his quest because he believes that Crooked Hillary Clinton will be forced out of the race - e-mail scandal! 

Join me on Wednesday, May 25th at the Anaheim Convention Center! #Trump2016 #MAGA Tickets. 

Crooked Hillary wants a radical 500% increase in Syrian refugees.  We can’t allow this.  Time to get smart and protect America! 

How can Crooked Hillary say she cares about women when she is silent on radical Islam, which horribly oppresses women? 

Why do the networks continue to put dopey @BillKristol on panels when he has called every single shot about me wrong for 2 yrs? 

Hillary Clinton is not qualified to be president because her judgement has been proven to be so bad!  Would be four more years of stupidity! 

Crooked Hillary said that I  want guns brought into the school classroom.  Wrong! 

"@dubilujane: I trust @realDonaldTrump more anyone ever to protect America. He WILL do the right thing for the U. S. A, without a  doubt. 

Thank you to all of the men and women who have served our country.  You are our true heroes!  #ArmedForcesDay. 

Crooked Hillary Clintons foreign interventions unleashed ISIS in Syria, Iraq and Libya.  She is reckless and dangerous! 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

. @CNN is so negative, getting even worse as I get closer.  Just had two anti-Trump losers with zero rebuttal from my team.  Turning off! 

"@RBacliff: Hillary wants to rip the guns out of America's hands.  No guns = no protection.  Get on #TrumpTrain & join @NRA to stop her. "

Crooked Hillary wants to get rid of all guns and yet she is surrounded by bodyguards who are fully armed.  No more guns to protect Hillary! 

While our wonderful president was out playing golf all day, the TSA is falling apart, just like our government!  Airports a total disaster! 

Crooked Hillary is spending tremendous amounts of Wall Street money on false ads against me.  She is a very dishonest person! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants to essentially abolish the 2nd Amendment.  No gun owner can ever vote for Clinton! 

Thank you @TheTodaysGolfer for the wonderful statement that "the new par 3 9th hole @Trump Turnberry could be the most dramatic in Britain. "

@montgomeriefdn  Colin, great to have you at Trump Turnberry.  So proud of you and your GREAT playing!  You made winning MAJORS look easy!

Crooked Hillary Clinton- discussing the #SecondAmendment at a private event.  #2A cc: @NRA. 

I am on my way!  See you all soon!. 

"A Call for Unity" by Jason Greenblatt @JasonDovEsq. 

Crooked Hillary can't even close the deal with Bernie - and the Dems have it rigged in favor of Hillary.  Four more years of this?  No way! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton looks presidential?  I don't think so!  Four more years of Obama and our country will never come back.  ISIS LAUGHS! 

Look where the world is today, a total mess, and ISIS is still running around wild.  I can fix it fast, Hillary has no chance! 

Crooked Hillary has zero imagination and even less stamina.  ISIS, China, Russia and all would love for her to be president.  4 more years! 

I said that Crooked Hillary Clinton is "not qualified" to be president because she has "very bad judgement" - Bernie said the same thing! 

Thank you @LtStevenLRogers.  We will respond to terrorism with strength in 2017!. 

How quality a woman is Rowanne Brewer Lane to have exposed the @nytimes as a disgusting fraud?   Thank you Rowanne. 

Looks like yet another terrorist attack.  Airplane departed from Paris.  When will we get tough, smart and vigilant?  Great hate and sickness! 

My list of potential U. S.  Supreme Court Justices was very well recieved.  During the next number of weeks I may be adding to the list! 

Some low-life journalist claims that I "made a pass" at her 29 years ago.  Never happened!  Like the @nytimes story which has become a joke! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Thank you Louisiana!  #Trump2016.

Why did Clinton supporter @AlisonForKY declare Crooked Hillary winner in KY when AP hasn't even called the race? 

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Democrats - the system is rigged against him.  Many of his disenfranchised fans are for me! 

Paul Begala, the dopey @CNN flunky and head of the Pro-Hillary Clinton Super PAC, has knowingly committed fraud in his first ad against me.

Wall Street paid for ad is a fraud, just like Crooked Hillary!  Their main line had nothing to do with women, and they knew it.  Apologize? 

Do you think Crooked Hillary will finally close the deal?  If she can't win Kentucky, she should drop out of race.  System rigged! 

I will be live tweeting my interview with @megynkelly on the Fox Network tonight at 8!  Enjoy!. 

I look forward to watching @megynkelly tonight, 8 PM ET.  It will be interesting to see how she treats me—I think she will be very fair. 

How can Crooked Hillary put her husband in charge of the economy when he was responsible for NAFTA, the worst economic deal in U. S.  history? 

Crooked Hillary said her husband is going to be in charge of the economy. If so, he should run,not her. Will he bring the "energizer" to D. C.? 

#VoteTrump at clerk's offices & 185 ballot drop boxes in #ORPrimary! Closes at 8pm!. 

Crooked Hillary can't close the deal with Bernie Sanders.  Will be another bad day for her! 

Amazing that Crooked Hillary can do a hit ad on me concerning women when her husband was the WORST abuser of woman in U. S.  political history\. 

Oregon is voting today.  Keep the big numbers going - VOTE TRUMP!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton put out an ad where I am misquoted on women.  Can't believe she would misrepresent the facts!  My hit was on China\. 

The pathetic new hit ad against me misrepresents the final line.  "You can tell them to go BLANK themselves" - was about China, NOT WOMEN! 

Wow, 30,000 e-mails were deleted by Crooked Hillary Clinton.  She said they had to do with a wedding reception.  Liar!  How can she run? 

"@AprilLaJune: OREGON votes today!  Go vote for @realDonaldTrump and kick it BIG TIME!. 

What Barbara Res does not say is that she would call my company endlessly, and for years, trying to come back.  I said no. 

I gave a woman named Barbara Res a top N. Y.  construction job, when that was unheard of, and now she is nasty.  So much for a nice thank you! 

"In politics, and in life, ignorance is not a virtue. " This is a primary reason that President Obama is the worst president in U. S.  history! 

The writer of the now proven false story in the @nytimes, Michael Barbaro, who was interviewed on CBS this morning, was unable to respond. 

Over 50 women were interviewed by the @nytimes yet they only wrote about 6.  That’s because there were so many positive statements. 

No wonder the @nytimes is failing—who can believe what they write after the false, malicious & libelous story they did on me. 

The failing @nytimes is greatly embarrassed by the totally dishonest story they did on my relationship with women. 

Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday joined @foxandfriends.. 

Thank you, Anthony @Scaramucci @WSJ "The Entrepreneur's Case for Trump". 

With the coming forward today of the woman central to the failing @nytimes hit piece on me, we have exposed the article as a fraud! 

@CNN A political commentator for @cnn, which I no longer watch, said "Trump showed some weakness in the Repub Primaries. " I set all-time record! 

Wow, Rowanne Brewer, the most prominently depicted woman in the failing @nytimes story yesterday, was on @foxandfriends saying Times lied\. 

The @nytimes is so dishonest.  Their hit piece cover story on me yesterday was just blown up by Rowanne Brewer, who said it was a lie! 

That was an amazing interview on @foxandfriends - I hope the rest of the media picks it up to show how totally dishonest the @nytimes is! 

Bernie Sanders is being treated very badly by the Dems.  The system is rigged against him.  He should run as an independent!  Run Bernie, run. 

Great new poll- thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

The @washingtonpost report on potential VP candidates is wrong.  Marco Rubio and most others mentioned are NOT under consideration. 

Thank you Georgia!  See you soon! #Trump2016. 

The media is really on a witch-hunt against me.  False reporting, and plenty of it - but we will prevail! 

Why did the failing @nytimes refuse to use any of the names given to them that I was so proud to have helped with their careers.  DISHONEST! 

Wow, I have had so many calls from high ranking people laughing at the stupidity of the failing @nytimes piece.  Massive front page for that! 

Why doesn't the failing @nytimes write the real story on the Clintons and women?  The media is TOTALLY dishonest!

If Crooked Hillary Clinton can't close the deal on Crazy Bernie, how is she going to take on China, Russia, ISIS and all of the others? 

An incredible honor to receive the endorsement of a person Ihave such tremendous respect for.  Thank you, Sheldon!. 

. @thehill  Your story about me & the carbon tax is absolutely incorrect—it is just the opposite.  I will not support or endorse a carbon tax! 

Senator Lindsey Graham called me yesterday, very much to my surprise, and we had a very interesting talk about national security, and more! 

Great meeting with @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Republican leaders in D. C.  #Trump2016. 

Great day in D. C.  with @SpeakerRyan and Republican leadership.  Things working out really well!  #Trump2016. 

If it were up to goofy Elizabeth Warren, we’d have no jobs in America—she doesn’t have a clue. 

In interview I told @AP that my taxes are under routine audit and I would release my tax returns when audit is complete, not after election! 

Isn’t it funny when a failed Senator like goofy Elizabeth Warren can spend a whole day tweeting about Trump & gets nothing done in Senate? 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren lied when she says I want to abolish the Federal Minimum Wage.  See media—asking for increase! 

Our Native American Senator, goofy Elizabeth Warren, couldn’t care less about the American worker…does nothing to help! 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is now using the woman’s card like her friend crooked Hillary.  See her dumb tweet “when a woman stands up to you…”

If the people of Massachusetts found out what an ineffective Senator goofy Elizabeth Warren has been, she would lose! 

Thanks Piers.. 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren didn’t have the guts to run for POTUS.  Her phony Native American heritage stops that and VP cold. 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren has been one of the least effective Senators in the entire U. S.  Senate.  She has done nothing! 

I don't want to hit Crazy Bernie Sanders too hard yet because I love watching what he is doing to Crooked Hillary.  His time will come! 

Big wins in West Virginia and Nebraska.  Get ready for November - Crooked Hillary, who is looking very bad against Crazy Bernie, will lose! 

Thank you Nebraska! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Thank you West Virginia! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016.

@MeetThePress I will be interviewed on @meetthepress this morning.  Enjoy! 

I will be interviewed on This Week with George S this morning.  Enjoy! 

#HappyMothersDay!. 

"@matandsher: I want a leader that will shoot straight with us.  The politicians can't.  @realDonaldTrump will give his all for us! 

. @EdGoeas thank you for your support tonight on @JudgeJeanine. 

Remember when the two failed presidential candidates, Lindsey Graham and Jeb Bush, signed a binding PLEDGE?  They broke the deal, no honor! 

I am honored that the great men and women of the @Teamsters have created a movement from within called Teamsters for Trump!  Thank you. 

I am going to keep our jobs in the U. S. , and totally rebuild our crumbling infrastructure.  Crooked Hillary has no clue!  @Teamsters\. 

Join me in Washington today! Spokane tickets:  tickets. 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren is weak and ineffective.  Does nothing.  All talk, no action -- maybe her Native American name? 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren and her phony Native American heritage are on a Twitter rant.  She is too easy!  I'm driving her nuts. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton wants completely open borders.  Millions of Democrats will run from her over this and support me. 

Just met with courageous family of Sarah Root in Nebraska.  Sarah was horribly killed by illegal immigrant, but leaves behind amazing legacy. 

Goofy Elizabeth Warren, Hillary Clinton’s flunky, has a career that is totally based on a lie.  She is not Native American. 

Let’s properly check goofy Elizabeth Warren’s records to see if she is Native American.  I say she’s a fraud! 

I hope corrupt Hillary Clinton chooses goofy Elizabeth Warren as her running mate.  I will defeat them both. 

Response to @LindseyGrahamSC. 

I hear @JoeNBC of rapidly fading @Morning_Joe is pushing hard for a third party candidate to run.  This will guarantee a Crooked Hillary win. 

Joe Scarborough initially endorsed Jeb Bush and Jeb crashed, then John Kasich and that didn't work.  Not much power or insight! 

Thank you to teachers across America!  When I become POTUS we will make education a far more important component of our life than it is now. 

Crooked Hillary has ZERO leadership ability.  As Bernie Sanders says, she has bad judgement.  Constantly playing the women's card - it is sad! 

Paul Ryan said that I inherited something very special, the Republican Party.  Wrong, I didn't inherit it, I won it with millions of voters! 

"@Ausbiz:  Many would say that you are the only talented person running for the top job this time!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain"

So many great endorsements yesterday, except for Paul Ryan!  We must put America first and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Governor Rick Perry said "Donald Trump is one of the most talented people running for the Presidency I've ever seen. " Thank you Rick! 

Unlike crooked Hillary Clinton, who wants to destroy all miners, I want wages to go up in America.  We will do so by bringing back jobs! 

Join me tomorrow!  #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain Omaha, Nebraska:  Oregon. 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise.  He should show them, & run as an Independent.

I will be interviewed on @TODAYshow and Good Morning America at 7:00 A. M. 

I will be interviewed on @Morning_Joe at 6:15 A. M.  Enjoy! 

I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! 

What a great evening we had.  So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary.  The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him! 

. @oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia! 

Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner.  We have won in every category.  You are very special people-I will never forget! 

Thank you Indiana!  #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana.  If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time & money\. 

Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today.  Made all sorts of crazy charges.  Can't function under pressure - not very presidential.  Sad!

I will be campaigning in Indiana all day.  Things are looking great, and the support of Bobby Knight has been so amazing.  Today will be fun! 

Everybody is talking about the protesters burning the American flags and proudly waving Mexican flags.  I want America First - so do voters! 

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me!  I will bring back jobs to USA. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation. " Actually, she has done poorly with such men! 

I will be interviewed on @CNN @NewDay  at 7:30 A. M.  Enjoy!

Will be in Terre Haute, Indiana in a short while -- big rally!  See you soon! 

I watched Sen.  Graham @FaceTheNation.  Why don't they say that I ran him out of the race like a little boy, and in the end he had no support? 

Thank you Indiana!  #Trump2016. 

I will be in Indiana on Sunday and Monday at four MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN rallies.  See you there! 

Thank you @MikeOzanian for the nice comments on @FoxNews today.  Great job! 

Trump locks down Delaware GOP delegates.  #Trump2016 #MAGA.

"@LexingtonBobby: @FoxNews @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump. 

The "protesters" in California were thugs and criminals.  Many are professionals.  They should be dealt with strongly by law enforcement! 

. @AC360  Anderson, so amazing.  Your mother is, and always has been, an incredible woman! 

We are now at 1001 delegates.  We will win on the first ballot and are not wasting time and effort on other ballots because system is rigged! 

Thank you Indiana!  #Trump2016. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers! 

Wow, the ridiculous deal made between Lyin'Ted Cruz and 1 for 42 John Kasich has just blown up.  What a dumb deal - dead on arrival! 

Thank you Costa Mesa, California!  31,000 people tonight with thousands turned away.  I will be back!  #Trump2016.

Thank you Evansville, Indiana!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

Heading to rally with Bobby now!  See you soon!. 

So many false and phony T. V.  commercials being broadcast in Indiana.  Reminds me of Florida where thousands were put up-I won in a landslide! 

I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon.  See you there! 

Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V. P. candidate who failed badly in her own effort\. 

I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A. M.  this morning.  Enjoy! 

Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech.  I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics! 

"@AnnetteJeanne: I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states.  I was SO HAPPY!  I really adore you Mr.  Trump, so much. "

Getting the strong endorsement of the great coach, Bobby Knight, has been a highlight of my stay in Indiana.  Big speech tomorrow with Bobby! 

I am in Indiana where we just had a great rally.  Fantastic people!  Staying at a Holiday Inn Express - new and clean, not bad!

Thank you for the incredible support- Melania, Barron, Ivanka, Jared, Tiffany, Don, Vanessa, Eric, and Lara!. 

Bernie Sanders has been treated terribly by the Democrats—both with delegates & otherwise.  He should show them, and run as an Independent!

The Cruz-Kasich pact is under great strain.  This joke of a deal is falling apart, not being honored and almost dead.  Very dumb!

Thank you Warwick, Rhode Island! #RIPrimary #VoteTrump. 

On the way to the great state of Rhode Island- big rally.  Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night! 

Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him.  Typical politician - can't make a deal work. 

Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. 

Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one.  Shows weakness! 

Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate.  Their donors & special interest groups are not happy with them.  Sad! 

Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination.  DESPERATION! 

I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing.  It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down.  Becoming irrelevant! 

"@DiamondandSilk: . @DonaldJTrumpJr awesome job on @CNNSotu.  DonaldTrump has integrity & he refuses 2 play the game call "Delegate Bribery"

"@newtgingrich: #NYPrimary turned Trump from frontrunner into presumptive #GOP nominee.

. @AndreBauer  Great job and advice on @CNN @jaketapper  Thank you! 

@BorisEP . @Borisep was great on @JudgeJeanine tonight.  Very smart commentary that will prove to be correct! 

As soon as John Kasich is hit with negative ads, he will drop like a rock in the polls against Crooked Hillary Clinton.  I will win! 

I had a great day campaigning in Connecticut.  Looking for a big vote on Tuesday! 

Congratulations to @seanhannity on his great ratings and ratings increase as reported by the @AP today.  Amazing job!

Thank you for the incredible support, Maryland!  This is a movement! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

I met Prince on numerous occasions.  He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy.  He will be greatly missed! 

Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237.  Now he can't get to 1237.  Drop out LYIN' Ted. 

Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory.  They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! 

Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race.  He said Kasich should get out for same reason.  I think both should get out! 

I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall.  Hopefully, it will be fun!  Enjoy. 7A. M. 

Thank you Maryland- what a great way to conclude the day!  Will be back soon.  #Trump2016.

Lyin’ Ted Cruz even voted against Superstorm Sandy aid and September 11th help.  So many New Yorkers devastated.  Cruz hates New York! 

New York, we will make America great again!. 

Kasich only looks O. K.  in polls against Hillary because nobody views him as a threat and therefore have placed ZERO negative ads against him\. 

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't win with the voters so he has to sell himself to the bosses-I am millions of VOTES ahead!  Hillary would destroy him & K\. 

"@DiamondandSilk: . @realDonaldTrump is who we need 2 fix this corrupted, rigged system.  4 no Profit, Under budget & ahead of schedule. 

Thank you for today's endorsement, New York Veteran Police Association!  #NewYorkValues. 

Thank you, California!  Will see you soon!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

I would have millions of votes more than Hillary except for the fact that I had 17 opponents and she just had a socialist named Bernie! 

Crooked Hillary Clinton is spending a fortune on ads against me.  I am the one person she doesn't want to run against.  Will be such fun! 

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses.  It won't work! 

Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary.  Despite a rigged delegate system, I am hundreds of delegates ahead of him. 

I'll be in one of my favorite places this morning, Staten Island.  Big crowd, will be fun!

The people of Colorado had their vote taken away from them by the phony politicians.  Biggest story in politics.  This will not be allowed! 

How is it possible that the people of the great State of Colorado never got to vote in the Republican Primary?  Great anger - totally unfair! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

I win a state in votes and then get non-representative delegates because they are offered all sorts of goodies by Cruz campaign.  Bad system!

. @FoxNews should be ashamed for allowing experts to explain how to make a nuclear attack! 

. @HeyTammyBruce- Thank you for your nice words on Fox today.  They never use my full statements on nuclear, which you would agree with! 

Great honor to have @GOP General Counsel, #JohnRyder as a Trump delegate in TN.  RNC meeting well worth it!  Unifying the party! 

Join me on Monday, April 4th in Milwaukee!  #WIPrimary #Trump2016Tickets. 

Wisconsin has suffered a great loss of jobs and trade, but if I win, all of the bad things happening in the U. S.  will be rapidly reversed! 

I will be in Wisconsin until the election.  Jobs, trade and immigration will be big factors.  I will bring jobs back home - make great deals! 

If @megynkelly stopped covering me on her show, her ratings would drop like a rock!  My h to h interview with @AC360 beat her by millions! 

Is it possible for @megynkelly to cover anyone but Donald Trump on her terrible show.  She totally misrepresents my words and positions!  BAD. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Can you believe that Ted Cruz, who has been killing our country on trade for so long, just put out a Wisconsin ad talking about trade? 

We must build a great wall between Mexico and the United States!. 

My new radio ad, airing today in Wisconsin!  See you soon! #WIPrimary #Trump2016. 

Does anybody like Lyin' Ted?. 

For the 1st time in American history, America’s 16,500 border patrol agents have issue a presidential primary endorsement—me!  Thank you. 

The National Border Patrol Council (NBPC) said that our open border is the biggest physical & economic threat facing the American people! 

The Club For Growth said in their ad that 465 delegates (Cruz) plus 143 delegates (Kasich) is more than my 739 delegates.  Try again! 

The Club For Growth,which asked me for $1,000,000 in an extortion attempt, just put up a Wisconsin ad with incorrect math. What a dumb group! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016.

@davidgregory . @DavidGregory got thrown off of TV by NBC, fired like a dog!  Now he is on @CNN being nasty to me.  Not nice! 

Final #'s just announced in the GREAT State of MO.  TRUMP WINS!  New certified #'s show a 365 vote increase for me- @ least 12 more delegates! 

Thank you!  #Trump2016. 

Trump defends campaign manager charged for bruising a reporter. 

Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Why is this reporter touching me as I leave news conference?  What is in her hand??. 

This was the reporters statement- when she found out there was tape from my facility, she changed her tune.. 

Victory press conference was over.  Why is she allowed to grab me and shout questions?  Can I press charges?. 

Why aren't people looking at this reporters earliest statement as to what happened, that is before she found out the episode was on tape? 

Wow, Corey Lewandowski, my campaign manager and a very decent man, was just charged with assaulting a reporter.  Look at tapes-nothing there! 

How come the @TODAYshow & @chucktodd show the new @NBCNews Poll for Hillary vs Bernie but do not show the SAME poll where I am killing Cruz? 

I have millions more votes/hundreds more dels than Cruz or Kasich, and yet am not being treated properly by the Republican Party or the RNC. 

Wow, @CNN has nothing but my opponents on their shows.  Really one-sided and unfair reporting.  Maybe I shouldn't do their town-hall tonight! 

We need to secure our borders ASAP.  No games, we must be smart, tough and vigilant.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN & MAKE AMERICA STRONG AGAIN! 

Lyin' Ted, I have already beaten you in all debates, and am way ahead of you in votes and delegates.  You should focus on jobs & illegal imm! 

Lyin'Ted Cruz is weak & losing big, so now he wants to debate again.  But, according to Drudge,Time and on-line polls, I have won all debates\. 

After the way I beat Gov.  Scott Walker (and Jeb, Rand, Marco and all others) in the Presidential Primaries, no way he would ever endorse me! 

"@PaulaDuvall2:  Cruz will say anything that is contrary to what you have to say.  If you're for Motherhood, he'll be against it! "

Just released that international gangs are all over our cities.  This will end when I am President! 

"@wolfblitzer:  Campaign-to-date popular GOP totals: @realDonaldTrump 7,546,980; @tedcruz 5,481,737; @JohnKasich 2,724,749" A BIG DIFFERENCE\. 

Ted Cruz is incensed that I want to refocus NATO on terrorism, as well as current mission, but also want others to PAY FAIR SHARE, a must! 

A detainee released from Gitmo has killed an American.  When will our so-called "leaders" ever learn! 

"Kirsten Powers: Anti- Trump Operative was Aggressively Shopping Cruz Story" via the Gateway Pundit. 

"@nellalda: @realDonaldTrump We stand by Trump 100%"  Thank you! 

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 7:30.  Things are looking good, had a great Easter-look forward to spending the week in Wisconsin! 

"@VictorConkle: #WIPrimary @realDonaldTrump will defeat ISIS and #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

The United States cannot continue to make such bad, one-sided trade deals.  There are only so many jobs we can give up.  No more! 

@dailybeast See Lyin' Ted, even the @DailyBeast (no fan of mine) says this story came from Rubio, not Trump!. 

Just to show you how unfair Republican primary politics can be, I won the State of Louisiana and get less delegates than Cruz-Lawsuit coming\. 

Why can't the pundits be honest?  Hopefully we are all looking for a strong and great country again.  I will make it strong and great!   JOBS! 

Another radical Islamic attack, this time in Pakistan, targeting Christian women & children.  At least 67 dead,400 injured.  I alone can solve\. 

Happy Easter to all, have a great day! 

My statement on NATO being obsolete and disproportionately too expensive (and unfair) for the U. S.  are now, finally, receiving plaudits! 

Wow, sleepy eyes @chucktodd is at it again.  He is do totally biased.  The things I am saying are correct.  - far better vision than the others\. 

I am interviewed on This Week on @ABC this morning.  Enjoy! 

Remember, I am the only candidate who is self-funding.  While I am given little credit for this by the voters, I am not bought like others! 

Don't believe the @FoxNews Polls, they are just another phony hit job on me.  I will beat Hillary Clinton easily in the General Election. 

Wisconsin's economy is doing poorly and like everywhere else in U. S. , jobs are leaving.  I will make our economy strong again - bring in jobs\. 

Nobody will protect our Nation like Donald J.  Trump.  Our military will be greatly strengthened and our borders will be strong.  Illegals out! 

Lyin' Ted Cruz is now trying to convince prople that his problems with The National Enq. were caused by me.  I had NOTHING to do with story! 

The press is going out of their way to convince people that I do not like or respect women, when they know that it is just the opposite! 

The media is so after me on women  Wow, this is a tough business.  Nobody has more respect for women than Donald Trump! 

"@pattiandsammi: @gullakhta99 @realDonaldTrump @Tytan01 @CNN WOMEN LOVE TRUMP.  TRUMP'S EXECS PREDOMINANTLY FEMALE.  #WOMEN4TRUMP"

"@stanColtrane: Turns out @glennbeck was wrong.  @realDonaldTrump had nothing to do with it.

"@11phenomenon: #LyingTed blames @realDonaldTrump for so many things I am starting to think he is having a mental health crisis. "

Wow, just released that $67 million in negative ads was spent on me.  How am I still number one - by a lot? 

I didn't start the fight with Lyin'Ted Cruz over the GQ cover pic of Melania, he did.  He knew the PAC was putting it out - hence, Lyin' Ted! 

Just won a big federal lawsuit similar in certain ways to the Trump U case but the press refuses to write about it.  If I lost-monster story! 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Endorsements for Lyin' Ted Cruz-. 

"@NeilTurner_: @realDonaldTrump Cruz & Rubio are scared!  WATCH ->. 

Europe and the U. S.  must immediately stop taking in people from Syria.  This will be the destruction of civilization as we know it!  So sad!

. @TheView T. V.  show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on.  I TELL THEM "NO"

Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years.  TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST! 

"@TimVincent56:  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future, Doers are already building it" #VoteTrump2016. 

It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media.  Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO! 

Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article.  I was so right! 

These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better! 

. @LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION!  Both talk about ISIS, do nothing! 

It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T. V.  shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run! 

"@missi51: . @realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people. "

We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N. A. T. O.  Why?  It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now! 

N. A. T. O.  is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win.  Could not have done it without you Joe! 

While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race! 

I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted.  Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing.  I spent a fraction of that and am first! 

I will be the best by far in fighting terror.  I’m the only one that was right from the beginning, & now Lyin’ Ted & others are copying me. 

Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror.  She’s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are! 

Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyin’ Ted Cruz.  Honestly, I can’t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion! 

Lyin’ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglas— just another dishonest politician. 

Thank you, Arizona!  #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain. 

Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G. Q.  model photo post of Melania.  That's why we call him Lyin' Ted! 

Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! 

Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona.  Thank you, I will never forget! 

Thank you, Arizona!  #Trump2016#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain. 

Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.   No way! 

Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G. Q.  shoot in his ad.  Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! 

Pres.  Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately & get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!

Watch this clip from earlier this year.  Time & time again I have been right about terrorism.  It’s time to get tough!. 

I have proven to be far more correct about terrorism than anybody- and it’s not even close.  Hopefully AZ and UT will be voting for me today! 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

President Obama looks and sounds so ridiculous making his speech in Cuba, especially in the shadows of Brussels.  He is being treated badly! 

Do you all remember how beautiful and safe a place Brussels was.  Not anymore, it is from a different world!  U. S.  must be vigilant and smart!

The protesters blocked a major highway yesterday, delaying entry to my RALLY in Arizona by hours, and the media blames my supporters! 

Why is it that the horrendous protesters, who scream, curse punch, shut down roads/doors during my RALLIES,  are never blamed by media?  SAD!

Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue.  No wonder he lost! 

Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich & Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz.  1/2\. 

Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz.  This is good for me! 

Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally.  Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS!  I beat Hillary\. 

Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000. 00 from me.  Remember, I said- NO!. 

Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me.  When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads.  Disgraceful! 

With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up.  Can anyone explain this? 

. @EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedStateand now he is the one leading opposition against me. 

Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz – and then he endorsed him.  No wonder nobody trusts politicians! 

Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement.  Also backed Jeb.  Lindsey got 0! 

Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Hillary Clinton has been involved in corruption for most of her professional life! 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Who should star in a reboot of Liar Liar- Hillary Clinton or Ted Cruz?  Let me know.. 

Highly overrated & crazy @megynkelly is always complaining about Trump and yet she devotes her shows to me.  Focus on others Megyn! 

Looking like my 5 victories on Tuesday will be just as good as if I won Ohio.  Two more days and Ohio was mine! 

See you in Arizona on Friday and Saturday.. 

Please explain to the dummies at the @WSJ  Editorial Board that I love to debate and have won, according to Drudge etc. , all 11 of them! 

. @WSJ is bad at math.  The good news is, nobody cares what they say in their editorials anymore, especially me! 

. @WSJ Editorial says "Clinton primary vote total is 8,646,551. Trump's is 7,533,692"-a knock.  But she had only 3 opponents-I had 16. Apologize\. 

The reason lyin' Ted Cruz has lost so much of the evangelical vote is that they are very smart and just don't tolerate liars-a big problem! 

Crazy @megynkelly is now complaining that  @oreillyfactor did not defend her against me - yet her bad show is a total hit piece on me. Tough! 

Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate.  How many times can the same people ask the same question?  I beat Cruz debating\. 

Crazy @megynkelly supposedly had lyin' Ted Cruz on her show last night.  Ted is desperate and his lying is getting worse.  Ted can't win! 

Stuart Stevens, the failed campaign manager of Mitt Romney's historic loss, is now telling the Republican Party what to do with Trump.  Sad! 

I will be interviewed on The O'Reilly Factor this evening at 8 pm on the Fox News Channel.  @oreillyfactor\. 

Thank you, Missouri!  #Trump2016. 

Wow, just won Missouri! 

I am making a big speech the night of the @FoxNews debate, but I wish everyone well.  Yesterday was a big day for me with 5 wins! 

Thank you to the Governor of Florida, Rick Scott, for your endorsement.  I greatly appreciate your support! 

In the last 2 weeks, I had $35M of negative ads against me in Florida & I won in a massive landslide. The establishment should save their $$! 

Yesterday was amazing—5 victories.   Lyin’ Ted Cruzhad zero.  Things are going very well! 

Is this what we want for a President?.

Can't watch Crazy Megyn anymore.  Talks about me at 43% but never mentions that there are four people in race.  With two people, big & over! 

"@DumpFoxNews: @FoxNews @megynkelly  If media wasn't so biased against Trump, he would've won all of the delegates. 

"@SCNAK45: @megynkelly is trying so hard to bash @realDonaldTrump it's ridiculous" Don't worry, everyone is wise to Crazy Megyn! 

"@J_Styborski: @realDonaldTrump @gregens21 @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly Hayes is looking depressed as well.. 

@FoxNews "@jsconlon11:  @BertShad @Foxnews @megynkelly I tried to give them a shot tonight, but they have the whole anti Trump cheerleading team. "

"@gregens21:  @BertShad @FoxNews @megynkelly She's choking on the results!  Call her justifiable Kelly.  Justifying everything she says. "

@FoxNews "@BertShad: Was going to watch @Foxnews for the primary results but saw @megynkelly - looks like #CNN tonight"

Word is that, despite a record amount spent on negative and phony ads, I had a massive victory in Florida.  Numbers out soon! 

A lot of complaints from people saying my name is not on the ballot in various places in Florida?  Hope this is false. 

I will bring our jobs back to the U. S. , and keep our companies from leaving.  Nobody else can do it.  Our economy will "sing" again. 

In presidential voting so far, John Kasich is ZERO for 22.  So why would he be a good candidate?  Hillary would beat him, I will beat Hillary! 

Ohio is losing jobs to Mexico, now losing Ford (and many others).  Kasich is weak on illegal immigration.  We need strong borders now! 

Watching John Kasich being interviewed - acting so innocent and like such a nice guy.  Remember him in second debate, until I put him down. 

#VoteTrump #SuperTuesday<Emoji: White heavy check mark>Florida<Emoji: White heavy check mark>Illinois<Emoji: White heavy check mark>Missouri<Emoji: White heavy check mark>North Carolina<Emoji: White heavy check mark>Ohio #TrumpTrain. 

North Carolina lost 300,000 manufacturing jobs and Ohio lost 400,000 since 2000.  Going to Mexico etc.  NO MORE IF I WIN, WE WILL BRING BACK! 

Just in, big news- I have been declared the winner of the CNMI Rep Caucus with 72. 8% of the vote!  Thank you!  #SuperTuesday #VoteTrump\. 

Good morning Ohio!  Some additional information from my daughter, @IvankaTrump!  #VoteTrump #SuperTuesday. 

Don't reward Mitt Romney, who let us all down in the last presidential race, by voting for Kasich (who voted for NAFTA, open borders etc. ). 

Please remember, I am the ONLY candidate who is self-funding his campaign.  Kasich, Rubio and Cruz are all bought and paid for by lobbyists! 

I will bring our jobs back to America, fix our military and take care of our vets, end Common Core and ObamaCare, protect 2nd A, build WALL\. 

Rubio is weak on illegal immigration, with the worst voting record in the U. S.  Senate in many years.  He will never MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Kasich voted for NAFTA, a disaster for Ohio, and now wants the even worse TPP approved.  Vote Trump and end this madness! 

@a "@mazzei48: @realDonaldTrump @BrazielCarol @FoxNews Listening to interview on replay of @A Savage Nation #GO DONALD TRUMP !!!!! " Thanks. 

"@wh:   WOW people are so misinformed on DonaldTrump character!  Watch this video!  Hillary and Bernie don't come close\. 

"@realwwshelton: @loudobbsnews I believe that @realDonaldTrump will be the big winner tomorrow. "  Thank you! 

"@BrazielCarol: @FoxNews @realDonaldTrump Who started this mess, the protesters of course .  And media made it worse. "

Sadly, this kind of stuff even happened to Ronald Reagan.  There is nothing nice about it!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

THANK YOU - Youngstown, Ohio!  I love you!  Get out & #VoteTrump tomorrow.  #Trump2016. 

Kasich has helped decimate the coal and steel industries in Ohio.  I will bring them back!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\. 

Gov Kasich voted for NAFTA, which devastated Ohio and is now pushing TPP hard- bad for American workers! 

Leaving the great people of North Carolina.  Amazing event.  Heading to Tampa now!  #VoteTrump\. 

Look forward to being in Tampa this afternoon.  Wonderful crowds.  Thank you, Florida! 

We don't have a country- if we don't have borders.  #VoteTrump Video. 

Just received from @PeteRose_14.  Thank you Pete!  #VoteTrump on Tuesday Ohio!  #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain. 

LYIN' TED. 

The failing @nytimes is truly one of the worst newspapers.  They knowingly write lies and never even call to fact check.  Really bad people! 

Because Gov.  Kasich cannot run in the state of Pennsylvania-he cannot win the nomination- & should not be allowed to compete in Ohio on Tue. 

Carly Fiorina- I agree!  Ted Cruz is just another politician.  All talk- no action!. 

Thank you Kevin.  With unification of the party, Republican wins will be massive!. 

Gov. Kasich of Ohio just stated on a morning show that he doesn't watch politics or anything on television, he only watches the @GolfChannel\. 

Ohio Gov. Kasich voted for NAFTA, from which Ohio has never recovered.  Now he wants TPP, which will be even worse.  Ohio steel and coal dying! 

Bernie Sanders is lying when he says his disruptors aren't told to go to my events.  Be careful Bernie, or my supporters will go to yours! 

"@alextrent4: It is repulsive that Trump was assaulted+politicians used that 2 further themselves+2 further victimize Trump!  DISGUSTING!! "

Wow, Kasich didn't qualify to run in the state of Pennsylvania, not enough signatures.  Big problem! 

USSS did an excellent job stopping the maniac running to the stage.  He has ties to ISIS.  Should be in jail!. 

Do the people of Ohio know that John Kasich is STRONGLY in favor of Common Core!  In other words, education of your children from D. C.  No way\. 

#EndCommonCore #Trump2016Video. 

Just finished my second speech.  20K in Dayton & 25K in Cleveland- perfectly behaved crowd.  Thanks- I love you, Ohio!. 

It is Clinton and Sanders people who disrupted my rally in Chicago - and then they say I must talk to my people.  Phony politicians! 

The last person that Hillary or Bernie want to run against is Donald Trump --- and that is fact! 

We are asking law enforcement to check for dishonest early voting in Florida- on behalf of little Marco Rubio.  No way to run a country! 

Word is-early voting in FL is very dishonest.  Little Marco, his State Chairman, & their minions are working overtime-trying to rig the vote. 

The rally in Cincinnati is ON.  Media put out false reports that it was cancelled!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016\. 

Thank you Dayton, Ohio!  20,000 supporters- largest in airport history!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

On my way to Dayton, Ohio.  Will be there soon! 

The rally in Cincinnati is ON.  Media put out false reports that it was cancelled.  Will be great - love you Ohio! 

Ohio had the biggest budget increase in the U. S.  If it were not for striking oil, they would be bust!  Governor Kasich in favor of TPP fraud! 

Absentee Governor Kasich voted for NAFTA and NAFTA devastated Ohio - a disaster from which it never recovered.  Kasich is good for Mexico! 

The organized group of people, many of them thugs, who shut down our First Amendment rights in Chicago, have totally energized America! 

I just got off the phone with the great people of Guam!  Thank you for your support!  #VoteTrump today!  #Trump2016\. 

Great news!  Thank you Governor Ralph DLG Torres!  #Trump2016.

Keep lightweight Marco and his friends out of the White House.  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Phony Club For Growth tried to shake me down for one million dollars, & is now putting out nasty negative ads on me.  They are total losers! 

Thank you Hawaii!  #Trump2016\.

Word is I am doing very well in Michigan and Mississippi!  Wow, and with all that money spent against me!  Will be going to Trump Jupiter now! 

I hear @NBCNews / @WSJ came out with another one of their phony polls.  While I am leading, they are totally discredited after last S. C.  poll\. 

The negative television commercials about me, paid for by the politicians bosses, are a total #Mediafraud.  When you watch, remember!

Mitt Romney had his chance and blew it.  Lindsey Graham ran for president, got ZERO, and quit!  Why are they now spokesmen against me?  Sad! 

Remember, I am the only one who is self-funding my campaign.  All of the other candidates are bought and paid for by special interests! 

Sun Sentinel says: Rubio lacks the experience, work ethic and gravitas needed to be president.  HE HAS NOT EARNED YOUR VOTE! 

"@EricTrump: Wishing our father tremendous luck in Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho & Hawaii today!  Amazing father!    @Q"

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Thank you @EricTrump!. 

Michigan, Mississippi, Idaho & Hawaii: Get out to VOTE and join the movement today!  Video. 

The Club for Growth is a very dishonest group.  They represent conservative values terribly & are bad for America.. 

People forget, it was Club for Growth that asked me for $1 million.  I said no & they went negative.  Extortion!. 

Ted Cruz Was For Welcoming Syrian Refugees Before He Was Against It. 

I employ many people in Hawaii at my great hotel in Honolulu.  I’ll be there very soon.  Vote for me, Hawaii! 

Cruz came to Mississippi, there was nobody there, he left the state.  I had a rally in Madison, MS with 10,000!  Thank you! 

@seanhannity I will be interviewed by @SeanHannity tonight at 10pm EST on @FoxNews!  Enjoy! 

New ad concerning lightweight Senator Marco Rubio. 

Thank you Idaho!  I love your potatoes- nobody grows them better.  As President, I will protect your market.. 

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio features Trump Univ.  students in FL.  attack ads- who submitted "excellent" reviews.. 

"@justin_sellers: Setup is underway @realDonaldTrump rally in Madison.  #MSPrimary    Thank you! 

It was great being in Michigan.  Remember, I am the only presidential candidate who will bring jobs back to the U. S. and protect car industry! 

Don't believe the millions of dollars of phony television ads by lightweight Rubio and the R establishment.  Dishonest people! 

Leaving for North Carolina.  Big crowd, will be fun! 

Congratulation to Adam Scott and all of the folks at Trump National Doral on producing a really great WGC Tournament.  Amazing finish! 

I will be using Facebook and Twitter to expose dishonest lightweight Senator Marco Rubio.  A record no-show in Senate, he is scamming Florida\. 

We cannot let the failing REPUBLICAN ESTABLISHMENT, who could not stop Obama (twice), ruin the MOVEMENT with millions of  $'s in false ads! 

Lindsey Graham is all over T. V. , much like failed 47% candidate Mitt Romney.  These nasty, angry, jealous  failures have ZERO credibility! 

Failed presidential candidate Lindsey Graham should respect me.  I destroyed his run, brought him from 7% to 0% when he got out.  Now nasty! 

"@Janetlarose1: @realDonaldTrump @FaceTheNation @jdickerson WASHINGTON VERSUS TRUMP <Emoji: Heavy red heart> &TRUMPS SUPPORTERS ...  #TRUMPDOG"

@MeetThePress . @meetthepress and @chucktodd did a 1 hour hit job on me today – totally biased and mostly false.  Dishonest media! 

I am at Trump National Doral-best resort in U. S.  Rory and Adam Scott are doing great!  Watch on NBC at 3:00 P. M.   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Thank you to @jdickerson and @FaceTheNation for a very fair and professional interview this morning.  No wonder you are #1 in the ratings! 

Fraud lightweight Marco made a TV ad on TrumpU featuring 2 people who signed these letters. 

The primary plaintiff in the phony Trump University suit wants to abandon the case.  Disgraceful! 

Nancy Reagan, the wife of a truly great President, was an amazing woman.  She will be missed! 

David Brooks, of the New York Times, is closing in on being the dumbest of them all.  He doesn’t have a clue. 

Thank you Michigan!  #Trump2016.

I would love to be at the Cadillac World Golf Championship @TrumpDoral in Miami- but even more so in Orlando with the #TrumpTrain! 

I am watching two clown announcers on @FoxNews as they try to build up failed presidential candidate #LittleMarco.  Fox News is in the bag! 

Romney's failed advisors, like campaign mgr Stuart Stevens are all over TV telling people how to win.  But they lost- don't know how to win! 

. @MittRomney was a disaster candidate who had no guts and choked!  Romney is a total joke, and everyone knows it!

Will be in Orlando, Florida, this afternoon.  25,000 people expected.  This is a movement like our GREAT COUNTRY has never seen before! 

Wow, big lines in Kansas.

The phony lawsuit against Trump U could have been easily settled by me but I want  to go to court.  98% approval rating by students.  Easy win\. 

Why did Mitt Romney BEG me for my endorsement four years ago? 

I am the only one who can beat Hillary Clinton.  I am not a Mitt Romney, who doesn't know how to win.  Hillary wants no part of "Trump"

Why would the great people of Florida vote for a guy who, as a Senator, never even shows up to vote - worst record.  Marco Rubio is a joke! 

I have brought millions of people into the Republican Party, while the Dems are going down.  Establishment wants to kill this movement! 

Failed candidate Mitt Romney,who ran one of the worst races in presidential history,is working with the establishment to bury a big "R" win! 

"@malski1954: I changed parties to vote for you, no one else measures up to you, The GOPe needs a reality check.  Our country is at stake"

Looks like two-time failed candidate Mitt Romney is going to be telling Republicans how to get elected.  Not a good messenger! 

Millions of dollars being spent on false TV ads by special interest groups who own Rubio & Cruz. When you see them think of your puppet POLS\. 

"@Johnsmi01433966: The establishment doesn't like you because they can't control you and get you to lie to us and keep ripping us off. "

Because of me, the Republican Party has taken in millions of new voters, a record.  If they are not careful, they will all leave.  Sad!

I would love to see the Republican party and everyone get together- and unify. Video.

I am going to repeal and replace ObamaCare!  Read more about my positions on healthcare reform here. 

. @CNN poll just hit 49% for Trump.  Interesting how my numbers have gone so far up since lightweight Marco Rubio has turned nasty.  Love it! 

"@HavBat22: @TeamCavuto #KenLangone is 100% correct #NeilCavuto.  And u and the rest of u #Fox muppets refuse to HEAR HIM. " So true!

Marco Rubio lost big last night.  I even beat him in Virginia, where he spent so much time and money.  Now his bosses are desperate and angry! 

Why would anyone in Florida vote for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio.  Check out his credit card scam, his house sale & his no show voting! 

The special interests and people who control our politicians (puppets) are spending $25 million on misleading and fraudulent T. V.  ads on me. 

"@JoeNBC: FOX calls Virginia for Trump.  If it holds, it's a big win for Trump and a big setback for Rubio, who needed to win the state.

Phylis Schlafly: 'Marco Rubio Betrayed Us All'. 

Little Marco Rubio treated America's ICE officers "like absolute trash" in order to pass Obama's amnesty.. 

Little Marco Rubio gave amnesty to criminal aliens guilty of "sex offenses. " DISGRACE!. 

Little Marco Rubio is just another Washington D. C.  politician that is all talk and no action.  #RobotRubio. 

"@EmaGabi23: Rubio was kicking back on his $80k boat he bought with lobbyist money and claimed it was from book sale profit lol"

Lightweight Senator Marco Rubio is polling very poorly in Florida.  The people can't stand him for missing so many votes - poor work ethic! 

Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida is just another Washington politician.. 

Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R!  A bad messenger for estab! 

As I stated at the press conference on Friday regarding David Duke- I disavow.. 

Why would the people of Texas support Ted Cruz when he has accomplished absolutely nothing for them.  He is another all talk, no action pol! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Little Marco Rubio, the lightweight no show Senator from Florida, is set to be the "puppet" of the special interest Koch brothers.  WATCH! 

Making a big speech in Alabama today.  So many people we had to move to a football stadium!  Come and join us! 

I am the only Republican who will get large numbers of Dems and Indies (crossover).  I will also get states that no other Republican can get. 

While Hillary and I both won South Carolina by big margins, Repubs got far more votes with a massive increase from past cycles. GROWING PARTY\. 

The Republican Establishment has been pushing for lightweight Senator Marco Rubio to say anything to "hit" Trump. I signed the pledge-careful\. 

While I hear the Koch brothers are in big financial trouble (oil), word is they have chosen little Marco Rubio, the lightweight from Florida\.

. #RogerStone was just banned by @CNN - their loss!  Tough, loyal guy. 

I started my business with very little and built it into a great company, with some of the best real estate assets in the World.  Amazing! 

I only wish my wonderful father, Fred, gave me $200 million to start my business like lightweight Rubio says.  He didn't - total fabrication! 

Fun to watch the Democrats working so hard to win the great State of South Carolina when I just won the Republican version - amazing people! 

I am self-funding my campaign and am therefore not controlled by the lobbyists and special interests like lightweight Rubio or Ted Cruz! 

Tax experts throughout the media agree that no sane person would give their tax returns during an audit.  After the audit, no problem! 

I unfairly get audited by the I. R. S.  almost every single year.  I have rich friends who never get audited.  I wonder why?

Lightweight Marco Rubio was working hard last night.  The problem is, he is a choker, and once a choker, always a choker!  Mr.  Meltdown. 

Wow, every poll said I won the debate last night.  Great honor! 

Lightweight choker Marco Rubio looks like a little boy on stage.  Not presidential material! 

Lying Ted Cruz and lightweight choker  Marco Rubio teamed up last night in a last ditch effort to stop our great movement.  They failed! 

Will be at Fort Worth (Texas) Convention Center at 11:30 A. M.  Big crowd - get there early!  Big announcement to be made! 

Why would the people of Florida vote for Marco Rubio when he defrauded them by agreeing to represent them as their Senator and then quit! 

Have a good chance to win Texas on Tuesday.  Cruz is a nasty guy, not one Senate endorsement and, despite talk, gets nothing done.  Loser! 

I will be making a speech at 12:00 in Fort Worth, Texas.  Really big crowd expected.  Will be talking about the debate last night-plus, plus!

All the online polls have me winning the debate.  I really enjoyed the evening.  Not easy, but good..

Thank you!  WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #Trump2016. 

Failed presidential candidate @MittRomney was made to look like a fool by Senator Harry Reid & didn't release his tax returns until 9/21/12. 

THANK YOU!   #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

FMR PRES of Mexico, Vicente Fox horribly used the F word when discussing the wall.  He must apologize!  If I did that there would be a uproar! 

Early on Ted Cruz said that if he didn't win South Carolina, it's over.  He didn't win- and lost to me in a landslide! 

Thank you Illinois!  #Trump2016. 

Join me in Oklahoma tomorrow night! #MakeYoutubeGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

I'm going to do what @MittRomney was totally unable to do- WIN! 

LETS MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Schedule & tickets. 

Signing a recent tax return- isn't this ridiculous?. 

Just for your info, tax returns have 0 to do w/ someone’s net worth.  I have already filed my financial statements w/ FEC.  They are great! 

Why doesn’t @MittRomney just endorse @marcorubio already. Should have done it before NH or Nevada where he had a little sway.  Too latenow! 

Mitt Romney, who was one of the dumbest and worst candidates in the history of Republican politics, is now pushing me on tax returns.  Dope! 

Great new poll.  Thank you Texas!  #VoteTrump #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.

. @RepChrisCollins  Chris, thank you so much for your wonderful endorsement.  I will not let you down!  @CNN\. 

When Ted Cruz quits the race and the field begins to clear, I will get most of his votes - no problem! 

Why would Texans vote for "liar" Ted Cruz when he was born in Canada, lived there for 4 years-and remained a Canadian citizen until recently\. 

When Mitt Romney asked me for my endorsement last time around, he was so awkward and goofy that we all should have known he could not win! 

"@Ward_II: Oh great @MittRomney is doing a @SenatorReid on @realDonaldTrump like losing the presidency wasn't enough #Trump2016" He's a fool\. 

Mitt Romney,who totally blew an election that should have been won and whose tax returns made him look like a fool, is now playing tough guy\. 

The polls show that I picked up many Jeb Bush supporters.  That is how I got to 46%.  When others drop out, I will pick up more.   Sad but true\. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

In all of television- the only one who said anything bad about last nights landslide victory-- was dopey @KarlRove.  He should be fired!

Big defeat last night in Nevada for Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.  @KarlRove on @FoxNews is working hard to belittle my victory.  Rove is sick!

Club for Growth is the group that came to my office seeking $1 million dollars.  I told them no and now they are doing negative ads. 

Great.  Just reported on @FoxNews that many people who supported @JebBush are now supporting me.  I knew that would happen, pundits didn't! 

Wow, great Ohio poll.  Shows me leading by 5 points, beating K!

Ted Cruz lifts the Bible high into the air and then lies like a dog-over and over again!  The Evangelicals in S. C.  figured him out & said no! 

Ted Cruz does not have the right "temperment" to be President.  Look at the way he totally panicked in firing his director of comm.  BAD! 

Wow was Ted Cruz disloyal to his very capable director of communication.  He used him as a scape goat-fired like a dog!  Ted panicked. 

Ted Cruz only talks tough on immigration now because he did so badly in S. C.  He is in favor of amnesty and weak on illegal immigration.

Ted Cruz said on @oreillyfactor that illegals sent out of country by my administration would come right back as citizens.  Another lie-crazy!

Ted Cruz should be disqualified from his fraudulent win in Iowa.  Weak RNC and Republican leadership probably won't let this happen!  Sad. 

Just saw the phony ad by Cruz - totally false, more dirty tricks.  He got caught in so many lies - is this man crazy? 

Ted Cruz has now apologized to Marco Rubio and Ben Carson for fraud and dirty tricks.  No wonder he has lost Evangelical support! 

Ted Cruz has been playing an ad about me that is so ridiculously false - no basis in fact.  Take ad down Ted.  Biggest liar in politics! 

Wow, Ted Cruz falsely suggested Marco Rubio mocked the Bible and was just forced to fire his Communications Director.  More dirty tricks! 

It is so important to audit The Federal Reserve, and yet Ted Cruz missed the vote on the bill that would allow this to be done. 

Thank you for your endorsement @paulteutulsr!  #BikersForTrump #VoteTrumpNV Video.

I will replace it with private plans, health savings accounts, & allow purchasing across state lines.  Maximum choice & freedom for consumer. 

I was referring to a backstop for pre-existing conditions.  I will eliminate the law, in its entirety, & replace it w/ something much better. 

I was asked about healthcare by Anderson Cooper & have been consistent- I will repeal all of #ObamaCare, including the mandate, period.

The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie.

Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses.  He wants to look cool, but it's far too late.  1% in Nevada! 

Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home. 

. @FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting.  They do not want Trump to win.  All negative! 

I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred!  Why does FOX put him on? 

@LindseyGraham . @lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews.

RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ:   #VoteTrumpSC\. 

JEB is a hypocrite!  Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician!. 

Jeb used Eminent Domain & took advantage of a disabled vet in the process.  (2/2). 

I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue & never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me!  (1/2)

Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(! ), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse?  Careful! 

I will be in South Carolina all week.  Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG!  Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\. 

Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them.  Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada\. 

Funny that Jeb(! ) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name. Then mommy, now brother! 

Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court.  Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! 

Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties!  Thank you! 

Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists & special interests - the bosses! 

Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution.  All donors & special ints\. 

Thank you for your support!  TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning.  Enjoy!

@tedcruz If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, & doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. 

Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC.  False advertising- desperate and sad! 

After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect & ill-informed ads. 

Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get. 

You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary.. 

The failing @NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online.  It's dead! 

NEVADA!  Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican. Visit:   from @IvankaTrump. 

How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? 

Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump & Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage. " Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest.  Perhaps all 3? 

Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech.  Do you think he will be this tough on Putin & others?. 

THANK YOU- Baton Rouge, Louisiana!  WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!  #Trump2016. 

Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana.  Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in.  Wow!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain\. 

Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson.  How can he preach Christian values?. 

"@truthinvest: @CNN @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze.  Just ask @RealBenCarson"

Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech.  Expecting a very large crowd!  See you soon.  #Trump2016#MakeAmericaGreatAgain\. 

We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me.  We are watching! 

Jeb failed as Jeb!  He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq).  Spent $120 million. Weak-no chance! 

He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM!  Hi DT\. 

. @MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word.  I never said the word, left an open blank.  Please apologize! 

Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st.  Big difference in capability! 

There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking.  It is bleeding red ink - a total loser! 

I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core.  Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! 

THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary. 

"@HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump ? Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it?   Get rid of it fast. 

I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core. 

Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P. M.  Tremendous crowd! 

So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment! 

Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people!  Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today. 

Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business.  Bad reporting- no money, no cred! 

Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer!  Liabilities are massive! 

Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex.  Paper will close soon! 

"@MarkHalperin: My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close.  BernieSanders B+: went too long\. 

Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you!  Now, off to South Carolina. 

Thank you, New Hampshire!  Departing with my amazing family now!  #FITN #NHPrimary. 

We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border.  We will build a WALL and have security. 

We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me.  We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! 

ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U. S. A.  or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results\.

I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40.  A. M.  Enjoy! 

The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION.  States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me.  Great! 

No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me.  I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so! 

I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot.  His family used private eminent domain! 

Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D. C. ) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love").  Not a leader! 

Thank you, New Hampshire!  #FITN.

America needs strong leadership.  Politicians can talk but they don’t get things done.  Video. 

Everybody is laughing at Jeb Bush-spent $100 million and is at bottom of pack.  A pathetic figure! 

Jeb Bush is desperate - strongly in favor of #CommonCore and very weak on illegal immigration. 

Thank you for your support at this mornings Town Hall- in Salem, New Hampshire.  #FITN #NHPrimary. 

Jeb Bush has zero communication skills so he spent a fortune of special interest money on a Super Bowl ad.  He is a weak candidate! 

My two wonderful sons, Don and Eric, will be on @foxandfriends at 7:02 - now!  Enjoy. 

So far the Super Bowl is very boring - not nearly as exciting as politics - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

This is the Cruz voter violation certificate sent to everyone, a misdemeanor at minimum.. 

. @oreillyfactor @KarlRove- as per the show, an even more serious Cruz charge is the fraudulent voter violation certificate sent to everyone. 

#ICYMI: @KarlRove & @oreillyfactor discuss what Ted Cruz did to the great people of Iowa- as they went to vote.. 

@BillOReilly Thank you @billoreilly & @KarlRove.  Ted Cruz should be immediately disqualified in Iowa, with each candidate moving up one notch. 

Sanders says he wants to run against me because he doesn't want to run against me.  He would be so easy to beat! 

THANK YOU to everyone in Little Rock, Arkansas tonight!  A record crowd of 12K.  #Trump2016. 

Stop the assault on American values.  Stand w/ Trump to #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #VotersSpeak. 

Thank you New Hampshire!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN. 

Dr.  Ben Carson blasted Ted Cruz for "deceit and dirty tricks and lies. "

Cruz just lied again- I am, and have been totally against #ObamaCare- repeal and replace! 

The State of Iowa should disqualify Ted Cruz from the most recent election on the basis that he cheated- a total fraud! 

This was sent out from Ted Cruz- as Iowans arrived at their caucus sites to vote.  #CruzFraud. 

I will be interviewed on @greta at 7:00 P. M.  Enjoy!  @FoxNews\. 

Based on the fraud committed by Senator Ted Cruz during the Iowa Caucus, either a new election should take place or Cruz results nullified. 

And finally, Cruz strongly told thousands of caucusgoers (voters) that Trump was strongly in favor of ObamaCare and "choice" - a total lie! 

The Voter Violation certificate gave poor marks to the unsuspecting voter(grade of F) and told them to clear it up by voting for Cruz.  Fraud\. 

Many people voted for Cruz over Carson because of this Cruz fraud.  Also, Cruz sent out a VOTER VIOLATION certificate to thousands of voters. 

During primetime of the Iowa Caucus, Cruz put out a release that @RealBenCarson was quitting the race, and to caucus (or vote) for Cruz. 

Ted Cruz didn't win Iowa, he stole it.  That is why all of the polls were so wrong and why he got far more votes than anticipated.  Bad! 

@CheriJacobus Great job on @donlemon tonight @kayleighmcenany @cherijacobus begged us for a job.  We said no and she went hostile.  A real dummy!  @CNN\. 

On my way to New Hampshire- expecting a big and spirited crowd!  #FITN #Trump2016. 

Anybody who watched all of Ted Cruz's far too long, rambling, overly flamboyant speech last nite would say that was his Howard Dean moment! 

"@stephbewitching @realDonaldTrump All you haters need to realize Trump got the second highest vote in history.  And he's never held office! "

"@restorereality  Iowa is meaningless... keep pushing forward, run the table in NH SC NV and Super Tuesday.  America needs you!  #TrumpTrain"

"@ellenEspence @realDonaldTrump Amazing job in Iowa!  Cruz just barely won. "

"@93101Dianne @realDonaldTrump if you can do that well in Iowa then I see you acing it in all other significant states.  Momentum is growing"

"@LoreWestphal @realDonaldTrump You MUST win the Presidency in 2016 !!! "

. @Morning_Joe @mikebarnicle on @realDonaldTrump: He finished 2nd but he made the turn successfully like a pro"

I don't believe I have been given any credit by the voters for self-funding my campaign, the only one.  I will keep doing, but not worth it! 

I will be talking about my wonderful experience in Iowa and the simultaneous unfair treatment by the media-later in New Hampshire.  Big crowd\. 

The media has not covered my long-shot great finish in Iowa fairly.  Brought in record voters and got second highest vote total in history! 

Because I was told I could not do well in Iowa, I spent very little there - a fraction of Cruz & Rubio.  Came in a strong second.  Great honor\. 

My experience in Iowa was a great one.  I started out with all of the experts saying I couldn't do well there and ended up in 2nd place.  Nice\. 

It all begins today - WE WILL FINALLY TAKE OUR COUNTRY BACK AND MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

I will be interviewed on Face The Nation with @jdickerson this morning.  Enjoy! 

I am in Iowa.  Will be interviewed on This Week With @GStephanopoulos  this morning.  ENJOY! 

If I would have done the last debate, a record would have been set (instead of the poor ratings recieved).  Also, VETS got $6,000,000. 

By not doing the failed, poorly rated debate, I was able to make the point of not allowing "unfairness" - while raising $6,000,000 for VETS. 

Wow, just saw an ad - Cruz is lying on so many levels.  There is nobody more against ObamaCare than me, will repeal & replace.  He lies! 

Ted Cruz is in trouble for not reporting his bank borrowing in his very important Financial Disclosure Form.  Very low interest loans, scam! 

Ted Cruz is totally unelectable, if he even gets to run (born in Canada).  Will loose big to Hillary.  Polls show I beat Hillary easily!  WIN! 

I will be going to church in Iowa this morning with my wife, Melania.  After church I will be making two speeches and touring the State! 

. @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and con man.  When I wouldn't give him free hotel rooms and much more, he endorsed Cruz.  @foxandfriends\. 

. @bobvanderplaats asked me to do an event.  The people holding the event called me to say he wanted $100,000 for himself. Phony @foxandfriends\. 

. @bobvanderplaats is a total phony and dishonest guy.  Asked me for expensive hotel rooms, free (and more).  I said pay and he endorsed Cruz! 

The Cruz campaign issued a dishonest and deceptive get out the vote ad calling voters "in violation. " They are now under investigation.  Bad! 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #IACaucus #CaucusForTrump.

. @oreillyfactor  The people of Iowa love the fact that I stuck up for my rights, as I will do for the U. S.  Also got $6,000,000 for our VETS! 

. @FoxNews is the only network that does not even mention my very successful event last night.  $6,000,000 raised in one hour for our VETS. 

Amazing that Ted Cruz can't even get a Senator like @BenSasse, who is easy, to endorse him.  Not one Senator  is endorsing Canada Ted! 

. @BenSasse looks more like a gym rat than a U. S.  Senator.  How the hell did he ever get elected?   @greta\. 

The great State of Nebraska can do much better than @BenSasse as your Senator.  Saw him on @greta - totally ineffective.  Wants paid for pols. 

The new e-mail release is a disaster for Hillary Clinton.  At a minimum, how can someone with such bad judgement be our next president?

The statement put out yesterday by @FoxNews was a disgrace to good broadcasting and journalism.  Who would ever say something so nasty & dumb\.

Heading to Sioux County, Iowa, where the crowd is amazing.  Dr.  Robert Jeffress will make the introduction.  Make America Great Again! 

Ted Cruz poll numbers are down big.  Because he was born in Canada and was, until recently, a Canadian citizen, many believe he cannot run! 

I am in Iowa watching all of these phony T. V.  ads by the other candidates.  All bull, politicians are all talk and no action-it won't happen!

A wonderful article by a writer who truly gets it.  I am for the people and the people are for me.  #Trump2016. 

Is Cruz honest?  He is in bed w/ Wall St.  & is funded by Goldman Sachs/Citi, low interest loans.  No legal disclosure & never sold off assets. 

Cruz did not renounce his Canadian citizenship as a US Senator- only when he started to run for #POTUS.  He could be Canadian Prime Minister. 

Cruz says I supported TARP, which gave $25 million to Goldman Sachs, the bank which loaned him the money he didn't disclose.  Puppet! 

@glennbeck The only reason irrelevant @GlennBeck doesn't like me is I refused to do his failing show - asked many times.  Very few listeners - sad! 

. @BrentBozell, one of the National Review lightweights, came to my office begging for money like a dog.  Why doesn't he say that? 

Just watched Jeb's ad where he desperately needed mommy to help him.  Jeb --- mom can't help you with ISIS, the Chinese or with Putin. 

Ted Cruz went down big in just released Reuters poll - what's going on?  Is it Goldman Sachs/Citi loans or Canada? 

Rush Limbaugh is great, tells it as he sees it---really honorable guy!  Thanks Rush!  #Trump2016\.

The late, great, William F.  Buckley would be ashamed of what had happened to his prize, the dying National Review! 

Very few people read the National Review because it only knows how to criticize, but not how to lead. 

National Review is a failing publication that has lost it's way.  It's circulation is way down w its influence being at an all time low.  Sad!

New Day on CNN treats me very badly.  @AlisynCamerota is a disaster.  Not going to watch anymore. 

Low energy candidate @JebBush has wasted $80 million on his failed presidential campaign.  Millions spent on me.  He should go home and relax! 

Sad sack @JebBush has just done another ad on me, with special interest money, saying I won't beat Hillary - I WILL.  But he can't beat me. 

So sad that @CNN and many others refused to show the massive crowd at the arena yesterday in Oklahoma.  Dishonest reporting!

I don't think Ted Cruz can even run for President until he can assure Republican voters that being born in Canada is not a problem.  Doubt! 

Ted Cruz is falling in the polls.  He is nervous.  People are worried about his place of birth and his failure to report his loans from banks! 

I loved being at Liberty University today!  Record setting crowd, unbelievable people!  Thank you Jerry and Becki!. 

We launched a new series of #Trump2016 videos via Facebook.  A new topic everyday!  Watch. 

A great morning with everyone @LibertyU!  Thank you!  Off to New Hampshire now.  #Trump2016   – at Lynchburg Regional Airport  (LYH)

Leaving for Liberty University.  I'll be speaking today in front of a record crowd.  #Trump2016\. 

Just a reminder that Ted Cruz supported liberal Justice John Roberts who gave us #Obamacare.. 

Thank you @IvankaTrump for the kind words.  I am very proud of the role model you are for so many.  NH & IA radio ad. 

"@pbralick: @BenKissel great on @greggutfeld @GregGutfeldShow @JoNosuchinsky too"  Thank you Ben for your nice comments on debate! 

I am self-funding my campaign - putting up my own money, not controlled.   Cruz is spending $millions on ads paid for by his N. Y.  bosses. 

Far more killed than anticipated in radical Islamic terror attack yesterday.  Get tough and smart U. S. , or we won't have a country anymore! 

Big announcement in Ames, Iowa on Tuesday!  You will not want to miss this rally!  #Trump2016. 

Iran is going to buy 114 jetliners with a small part of the $150 billion we are giving them... but they won't buy from U. S. , rather Airbus! 

In Iran deal we get 4 prisoners.  They get $150 billion, 7 most wanted and many off watch list.  This will create great incentive for others! 

Interesting read from Peggy Noonan.. 

Is this the New York that Ted Cruz is talking about & demeaning?. 

Wow!  Ted Cruz received $487K in campaign contributions, $11M from a NY hedge fund mogul, & $1M low int.  loan from Goldman Sachs.  Hypocrite\. 

Departing NH now- great morning with record crowd in Portsmouth- in a snow storm!  Thank you!. 

@tedcruz Greatly dishonest of @TedCruz to file a financial disclosure form & not list his lending banks- then pretend he is going to clean up Wall St\. 

@tedcruz When will @TedCruz give all the New York based campaign contributions back to the special interests that control him. 

Everybody that loves the people of New York, and all they have been thru, should get hypocrites like Ted Cruz out of politics! 

If Ted Cruz is so opposed to gay marriage, why did he accept money from people who espouse gay marriage? 

Ted is the ultimate hypocrite.  Says one thing for money, does another for votes.. 

Great new numbers.  Thank you!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Ted Cruz purposely, and illegally, did not list on his personal disclosure form personally guaranteed loans from banks.  They own him! 

Based on the fact that Ted Cruz was born in Canada and is therefore a "natural born Canadian," did he borrow unreported loans from C banks? 

Oh no, just reported that Ted Cruz didn't report another loan, this one from Citi.  Wow, no wonder banks do so well in the U. S.  Senate. 

The Ted Cruz wiseguy apology to the people of New York is a disgrace.  Remember, his wife's employer, and his lender, is located there! 

Was there another loan that Ted Cruz FORGOT to file.  Goldman Sachs owns him, he will do anything they demand.  Not much of a reformer! 

Ted Cruz said he "didn't know" that he was a Canadian Citizen.  He also FORGOT to file his Goldman Sachs Million $ loan papers. Not believable\. 

Ted Cruz was born in Canada and was a Canadian citizen until 15 months ago.  Lawsuits have just been filed with more to follow.  I told you so\. 

More radical Islam attacks today - it never ends!  Strengthen the borders, we must be vigilant and smart.  No more being politically correct.

Thank you to our law enforcement officers!  #LESM #Trump2016. 

Union Leader refuses to comment as to why they were kicked out of the ABC News debate like a dog.  For starters, try getting a new publisher! 

UL has lost all credibility under Joe McQuaid w circulation dropping to record lows.  They aren't worthy of representing the great people NH. 

This is really unfair and a conflict for all the other candidates.  I said it should not be allowed and ABC agreed. 

If their highly unethical behavior, including begging me for ads, isn’t questionable enough, they have endorsed a candidate who can’t win. 

I am pleased to announce that I had the Union Leader removed from the upcoming debate.. 

Remember, get TIME magazine!  I am on the cover.  Take it out in 4 years and read it again!  Just watch...

Weak & ineffective @JebBush is doing ads where he shows his statement in the debate but not my response.  False advertising! 

I have an idea for @JebBush whose campaign is a disaster.  Try using your last name and don't be ashamed of it! 

. @SenTedCruz Ted--free legal advice on how to pre-empt the Dems on citizen issue.  Go to court now & seek Declaratory Judgment--you will win! 

Massive crowd in VT tonight.  Venue not big enough.  Officials say NO to outside event and sound system.  Arrive early! 

Man shot inside Paris police station.  Just announced that terror threat is at highest level.  Germany is a total mess-big crime.  GET SMART! 

I will be in beautiful Burlington, Vermont, tonight for a rally.  Will be great fun.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

It was a very wise move that Ted Cruz renounced his Canadian citizenship 18 months ago.  Senator John McCain is certainly no friend of Ted! 

. @Macys was one of the worst performing stocks on the S&P last year, plunging 46%.  Very disloyal company.  Another win for Trump!  Boycott. 

The failing @UnionLeader newspaper in N. H.  just sent The Trump Organization a letter asking that we take ads.  How stupid, how desperate! 

Do you believe that @UnionLeader in NH was demanding ads?  Look at enclosed letter from them, just received. 

I will be on @wolfblitzer for a @CNNSitRoom interview today.  Please join us 5PM ET. 

Huge crowd expected tomorrow night!  VT Police say first come, first serve.  Arrive early! 

Don’t like @SamuelLJackson’s golf swing.   Not athletic.  I’ve won many club championships.  Play him for charity! 

I don’t cheat at golf but @SamuelLJackson cheats—with his game he has no choice—and stop doing commercials! 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to my son, @EricTrump!  Very proud of you!. 

Germany is going through massive attacks to its people  by the migrants allowed to enter the country.  New Years Eve was a disaster.  THINK!

I don’t know @SamuelLJackson, to best of my knowledge haven't played golf w/him & think he does too many TV commercials—boring.  Not a fan. 

Wow @UnionLeader circulation in NH has dropped from 75,000 to around 10—bad management.  No wonder they begged me for ads.

By the way, Hillary & the MSM forgot to mention that Hillary is in the Al-Shabaab terror video.. 

The worst thing Hillary could do is have her husband campaign for her.  Just watch. 

Iran, with all of the money and all else given to them by Obama, has wanted a way to take over Saudi Arabia & their oil.  THEY JUST FOUND IT! 

"@barbaraslavin1: @RuthMarcus @washingtonpost bashing distinguished women journalists won't win you votes"  She is 3rd rate, a total dummy!

. @RuthMarcus of the @washingtonpost was terrible today on Face The Nation. No focus, poor level of concentration-but correct on Hillary lying\. 

@MeetThePress . @chucktodd said today on @meetthepress that "attacking Bill to get to Hillary has never worked before. " Wrong - attacked him in '08 & won! 

Does anybody remember when Bill Clinton, in 2008, worked long and hard for Hillary?  She LOST!  Now Bill is at it again.  Just watch. 

Thank you for your support in Biloxi, MS!  Let's ALL get out & VOTE in 2016, so we can #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!. 

Hillary said that guns don't keep you safe.  If she really believes that she should demand that her heavily armed bodyguards quickly disarm! 

Al-Shabbab, not ISIS, just made a video on me - they all will as front-runner & if I speak out against them, which I must.  Hillary lied! 

Hillary Clinton lied last week when she said ISIS made a D. T.  video.  The video that ISIS made was about her husband being a degenerate. 

Just returned from Mississippi - a great evening. 

"@MMMDigits: Well done #Biloxi.... great display of Southern pride and hospitality at @realDonaldTrump event.  Fired up and ready to go!! "

"@namusca: @realDonaldTrump @EricTrump @DiamondandSilk #Trump is much better than any rock concert!  He knows how to fill a stadium. "

"@Granite_Hope: @brandonstinney How can you deny this fact. HillaryClinton and BarackObama are the two people who made #ISIS a big problem"

Just arrived in Mississippi for the rally.  Word is that the crowd is overflowing and massive.  Will be an amazing evening! 

Heading to Biloxi, Mississippi.  Massive crowds expected.  Thank you for your support!  #VoteTrump2016. 

Remember, I am self-funding my campaign, the only one in either party.  I'm not controlled by lobbyists or special interests-only the U. S. A.! 

When I look at all of the money the special interests and lobbyists are giving to candidates, beware - the candidates are mere puppets $$$$! 

I hope Bill Clinton starts talking about women's issues so that voters can see what a hypocrite he is and how Hillary abused those women! 

Hillary Clinton doesn't have the strength or stamina to be president.  Jeb Bush is a low energy individual, but Hillary is not much better! 

Hillary Clinton said that it is O. K.  to ban Muslims from Israel by building a WALL, but not O. K.  to do so in the U. S.  We must be vigilant! 

. @JebBush is a low energy "stiff" who should focus his special interest money on the many people ahead of him in the polls.  Has no chance! 

. @JebBush is a sad case.  A total embarrassment to both himself and his family, he just announced he will continue to spend on Trump hit ads! 

Massive crowds expected in Mississippi tomorrow night.  Look forward to it!  2015 IN PHOTOS. 

#VoteTrump2016 & together we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!  THANK YOU for your support!. 

Thank you so much to   for naming me the 2015 Man of the Year.  This is indeed a great honor for me! 

The person that Hillary Clinton least wants to run against is, by far, me.  It will be the largest voter turnout ever - she will be swamped! 

"@codyraymille: I have never been interested in politics but because of you I want to get my political science degree.  #trump2016"  Great!

I never thought I'd be saying this but I've really enjoyed  @RichLowry on television lately, and he was terrific hosting @seanhannity\. 

Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) is desperately trying to sell the @UnionLeader.  It's a loser, and my comments haven't helped him much.

THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa!  The silent majority, is silent no more! #Trump2016 #FITN. 

Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical. 

The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper. 

Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate! 

New #ReutersPoll.  Thank you America!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans & America! 

We need a real President!. 

Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today.  Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! 

So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place.  Jeb Bush has spent $59 million & done.  Run country my way! 

My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place). Now I will spend big in Iowa/N. H. /S. C.

Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months.  Video. 

Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double & triple them, a disaster! 

Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders. We need smart and strong leadership now! 

Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries.  We now are part time, sad!  I WILL FIX! 

The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years.  BAD\. 

If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! 

"@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you! "  Thank you.

The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory.  The Dems LOVE IT!  Be smart and win for a change! 

R. P. Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row.  Will now not allow desperately needed new voters.  Suicidal mistake.  RNC MUST ACT NOW! 

It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters.  BAD!

Thank you!  #Trump2016. 

Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate! 

"@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive\. 

A new terror warning was issued for European cties.  At what point do we say we have had enough and get really tough and smart.  Weak leaders! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 Story. 

Criminal deportations in the U. S.  are the lowest number in many years.  We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country.  MUST CHANGE! 

The Phoenix V. A. , it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before.  The wait is horrendous, and people are dying.  I will fix it\. 

The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary. 

. @chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting... and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings.  I will beat Hillary! 

@CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015.  Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again! 

"@deedeegop: Thank u Mr.  Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States #MakeAmericaGreatAgain.  So nice!

"@ClassySnobbb: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm reading #CrippledAmerica!  Best book ever.  Thank you! 

When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it? " Never! 

Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V. A.  That will stop, I will fix this quickly! 

Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE?  He's spent $59 million and is at 3%. 

We have many problems in our house (country! ), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally.  Politics! 

@DeedeeSorvino . @deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly.  Have her on more! 

Merry Christmas to all.  Have a great day and have a really amazing year.  Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  It will be done! 

. @danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today.  Very wise indeed! 

@nbc . @HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video.  Bad reporting.  Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it! 

"@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True, a total distortion of the facts! 

I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

@MeetThePress . @meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz.  Be honest Chuck! 

Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll?  CNN even better! 

Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS.  It's about time! 

Next year will be an interesting one.  I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly\. 

Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias.  Think about Bill! 

Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll.  Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%.  Stop throwing your money down the drain! 

In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD! 

Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing.  He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot).  That's what U. S.  needs! 

"@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE... Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18... Big Detail\. 

A great Christmas movie & perfect #TBT!  #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Story. 

"@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run...  She's a criminal. "

"@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run...  She's a criminal. "  Good question! 

Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign. " I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity\. 

Merry Christmas & Happy Holidays! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to.  I have great respect for women.  BE CAREFUL! 

It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.   New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories.  21 pt.  Lead\. 

Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime.  He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased.  Still thinks Romney won.  Unfair coverage of Trump\. 

. @FoxNews treats me so badly.  Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll.  All negative! 

The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids.  Bad\. 

The silent majority- is silent no more!  Remember the importance of VOTING! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

The Hillary Clinton staged event yesterday was pathetic.  Be careful Hillary as you play the war on women or women being degraded card. 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Thank you America!  Together- we will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain!. 

Big news just out - NEW @CNN POLL  TRUMP  39 and leads in every major category.  Likeability way up.  CRUZ 18  CARSON 10  RUBIO 10\. 

We need a PRESIDENT with strength, stamina, heart and incredible deal making skill if our country is ever going to be able to prosper again! 

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong.  Sad! 

When I said that Hillary Clinton got schlonged by Obama, it meant got beaten badly.  The media knows this.  Often used word in politics! 

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016. 

Wow, new Reuters Poll just out.  Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!   TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge! 

For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly.  Dishonest #MSM\. 

@nealconan NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls. " #Hypocrisy\. 

Once again, #MSM is dishonest.  "Schlonged" is not vulgar.  When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly. 

Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements.  He is really pathetic! 

Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television.  Boring and biased!

"@qbeacademy: Well I'm at 42% and your at 3% . You know Jeb you started over here you keep on moving further and further off stage.   Classic"

. @JebBush's opening and closing in the debate were said by all to be terrible--fumbled around, incoherent. 

Why doesn't @JebBush, in his ads, show my answer to his statement in the debate? 

Will @JebBush, in his phony advertising campaign, show himself asking me to apologize to his wife in the debate? 

. @JebBush just took millions of $'s in special interest money to look like a tough guy.  Will never work! 

Weak and low energy @JebBush, whose campaign is a disaster, is now doing ads against me where he tries to look like a tough guy.

Hillary said with respect to ISIS, "we are finally where we need to be. " Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?   MAGA! 

I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate.  There never was a video. 

Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst. " She made up story-want apology!

Why isn't anyone using the @CNN Iowa Poll with me having a big lead.  They only want to use the one negative poll (2nd place). Dishonest press\.

"@Ajdx4Sdesq: @CNN @donlemon @realDonaldTrump this is the best interview so far.  Honest, well reasoned and without all the name calling. 

"@michaelUrso2: Mr Trump did you deny Megyn Kelly.  What is her issue!  I used to like her.  Can't stand her now.  Very little talent!  @FoxNews\. 

Thank you @oreillyfactor for your wonderful editorial as to why I should have been @TIME Magazine's Person of the Year.  You should run Time! 

Great leaders listen to and support law enforcement officials.  Police discuss no-go areas. 

Why does @CNN bore their audience with people like @secupp, a totally biased loser who doesn't have a clue.  I hear she will soon be gone! 

. @secupp, who can't believe that her candidate has bombed so badly, is one of the dumber pundits on T. V.  Hard to watch, zero talent!  @CNN\. 

. @donlemon on @CNN at 10:00 P. M. 

Thank you for all of your support, South Carolina!  #Trump2016. 

I am interviewed on the  @oreillyfactor tonight at 8:00.  Then at 10:00, I am interviewed by @donlemon on @CNN.  Enjoy! 

"Carter Banned Iranians From Coming To U. S.  During Hostage Crisis". 

" Haim Saban: Hillary Clinton’s Top Hollywood Donor Demands Racial Profiling of Muslims". 

The police in London say I’m right.  Major article in Daily Mail.  “We can’t wear uniform in our own cars. ”. 

Thank you @JebBush- you finally get it!. 

Thank you, Piers, they don't know what they're getting into.. 

. @Mayor_Nutter of Philadelphia, who is doing a terrible job, should be ashamed for using such a disgusting word in referring to me. Low life! 

I am signing copies of my book CRIPPLED AMERICA.  Makes a great holiday gift.  Order yours now!     … …

"Rupert Murdoch Defends Trump: 'Complete Refugee Pause' Makes Sense' ". 

I told you @TIME Magazine would never pick me as person of the year despite being the big favorite They picked person who is ruining Germany\. 

"@mysteriousLoser: @realDonaldTrump did you hear the mayor nutter of philadelphias comments towards you?  Ignorance" Yes, he is a crude dope! 

"@ssheaver: @realDonaldTrump @nytimes @CNN   Wow! 

"@ray_aub:  @nytimes @CNN People forget the policies of leaders like @JebBush allowed 9/11 killers to immigrate, drive, & pilot planes"

Hillary Clinton does not have the STRENGTH or STAMINA to be President.  We need strong and super smart for our next leader - or trouble! 

The last person corrupt Hillary Clinton wants to run against is Donald J.  Trump.  I'll end up beating her in every state.  New Fox Poll-Trump! 

"@USAforDJTRUMP: @realDonaldTrump @CNN Mr.  Trump, you need to get some rest.  We need you to stay healthy so that you can be our President! "

"@YitzySchwartz:  @CNN anyone who hates on Trump hates on America.  We are a proud nation lacking a leader.  Choose Trump to bring us"

Great poll numbers just coming out of New Hampshire.  BIG lead for "Trump" according to @CNN! 

Wow, what a day.  So many foolish people that refuse to acknowledge the tremendous  danger and uncertainty of certain people coming into U. S. 

Our country is facing a major threat from radical Islamic terrorism.  We better get very smart, and very tough, FAST, before it is too late! 

Despite my great respect for King Abdullah II, I will not be visiting Jordan at this time.  This is in response to the false @AP report. 

Prior to the end of the year, I will be traveling to Israel.  I am very much looking forward to it. 

Great new poll from NH.  Thank you!  We need to keep this country safe!  #Trump2016. 

Will be on @ABC News tonight at 6:30.  Interviewed by the legendary @BarbaraJWalters!  Enjoy\. 

The legendary @BarbaraJWalters will be asking me questions about the Presidential campaign on @WNTonight at 6:30 PM. 

A very big poll is coming out at 6 PM in New Hampshire.  Will be very interested in the results. 

A new poll indicates that 68% of my supporters would vote for me if I departed the GOP & ran as an independent..

I wish the @WSJ Wall Street Journal had reported the just out @CNN Iowa Poll correctly.  I lead by a wide margin,13 points, going up big! 

Just won IOWA @CNN Poll BIG: Trump 33% Cruz 20% Rubio 11%,  but @WSJ reported "Cruz momentum" but nothing about the fact that I easily won!
