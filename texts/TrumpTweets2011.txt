The Washington Establishment will never rein in government spending, waste, fraud and abuse.  A great thinker and outsider is needed. 

When will the US government finally classify China as a currency manipulator?  China is robbing us blind and @BarackObama defends them. 

Both @Rosie and @RonPaul think America is responsible for 9/11.        (cont). 

Looks like Michele Bachmann will finish dead last in Iowa while her own campaign chairman bails on her.  (cont). 

I play golf to relax.  My company is in great shape.  @BarackObama plays golf to escape work while America goes down the drain. 

NYC should hold a parade for returning Iraq and Afghanistan veterans. 

I'm sending @BarackObama an autographed copy of #TimeToGetTough.  He could use it. 

I like Russell Brand, but Katy Perry made a big mistake when she married him.  Let's see if I'm right---I hope not. 

America wasted billions and precious lives in Iraq and Iran will soon take control--very very sad. 

I'm right, TPM is wrong - @BarackObama did not issue a special statement for Christmas--however he issued one (cont). 

The Mar-a-Lago Club has the best meatloaf in America.  Tasty.. 

@timetogettough I predicted the 9/11 attack on America in my book "The America We Deserve" and the collapse of Iraq in @TimeToGetTough. 

Americans Elect on track to put an Indy Presidential candidate on the ballot in all 50 states. 

He is destroying our country:@BarackObama has requested to raise our debt limit to over $16. 4Trillion by the end (cont). 

"It's important that we help poor people to become independent, self-sufficient individuals who gain the benefits of work. " #TimeToGetTough\. 

China has 5 oil projects in Iraq and we didn't get anything from the Iraqis except asked to leave.  Iraq is going (cont). 

The Fed's reckless monetary policies will cause problems in the years to come.  The Fed has to be reined in or we will soon be Greece. 

What a convenient mistake: @BarackObama issued a statement for Kwanza but failed to issue one for Christmas..

Govt.  collapsing in Iraq only 2 weeks after withdrawal of our troops.  Sadly, I called this one and please remember, I alone called it. 

The habitual vacationer, @BarackObama, is now in Hawaii.  This vacation is costing taxpayers $4 milion +++  while there is 20% unemployment.

The Keystone pipeline will create 20,000 jobs and make us less energy dependent from the Middle East.  @BarackObama says No! 

The safest way to preserve Medicare is with a robust and vibrant economy.  We should lower corporate and capital gain taxes immediately. 

A week after Biden says that the Taliban is not our enemy, the Taliban demand that we pay Iraq for a 9 year occupation.. 

Even if @BarackObama stays in DC, taxpayers will pay millions for his Hawaii vacation when Americans are struggling. 

“Consider the fact that for every gallon of gas you put in your car, you pay 45. 8 cents in state, local, and federal taxes. ” #TimeToGetTough\.

My new book #TimeToGetTough is the best present of the holiday season.  A great gift for anyone who cares about this country.

My @FoxNews interview with @gretawire discussing how @BarackObama is delusional and how a 3rd party candidate can win.. 

Barney Frank looked disgusting--nipples protruding--in his blue shirt before Congress.  Very very disrespectful. 

Congratulations to @AmericansElect for winning a spot on the California 2012 ballot.  A major feat!. 

He is delusional: @BarackObama believes that he is the 4th best POTUS ever. 

The WH yesterday defended Biden's comments that the Taliban aren't our enemy.  When did the American people decide this?. 

"Obamacare has to be killed now before it grows into an even bigger mess, as it inevitably will. " #TimeToGetTough\. 

"The sad truth is some Republicans in Congress are clueless when it comes to negotiation. "  #TimeToGetTough\. 

I really enjoyed last night's Tele-Town Hall with @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom Coalition.  Thanks to the thousands who joined. 

I still can't believe we didn't t take the oil from Iraq. 

My interview with @ASavageNation discussing #TimeToGetTough, my 2012 plans and Iraq. 

For last minute shopping, my new book #TimeToGetTough is a great choice....

Joe Biden said that the Taliban 'is not our enemy. ' I wonder how our troops in Afghanistant that are under attack view Biden's statement. 

What a shock!  The U. S.  Capitol Christmas tree pays homage @BarackObama but failed to mention Jesus. 

He thinks that the wealth you create belongs to the gov't.  @BarackObama doesn't respect the fact that the money he wastes belongs to us. 

"He thinks that the wealth you create belongs to the government--@BarackObama doesn't respect the fact that the (cont). 

"People who have the ability to work should.  But with the government happy to send checks, too many of them don't. " #TimeToGetTough\.

"It's a plain fact: free trade requires having fair rules that apply to everyone. "#TimeToGetTough\. 

"We need a tax system that is fair and smart--one that encourages growth, savings, and investment. " #TimeToGetTough\. 

China taxing imports from the US --22%-- why aren't we taxing China? 

Dummies left Iraq without the oil--not believable! 

Iraq in political turmoil one day after we leave---I told you so. 

Even @BarackObama's former National Security Advisor Jim Jones has called the Keystone pipeline  'a national must. ' America needs it. 

Congratulations to my son Eric for making the Forbes 30 under 30 list.  He's done a great job!. 

Barney Frank admited that ObamaCare does have 'death panels' yesterday.  Obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed. 

With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation.  Just plain wrong. 

Our diplomats are weak: @JonHuntsman's China policy proves why we need businesmen to negotiate against China. 

Railing at Obama over China: @maggiepolitico. 

@TheDCVince RT @TheDCVInce: Trump's letter to Obama: China thinks you're weak. 

Looking forward to Tuesday's tele town hall @7:30PM with @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom Coalition.  Will be a great time! 

My @FoxNews interview on @FNTTHe Five discussing the #TimeToGetTough, the GOP primary and China's tariff on our cars.

@AmericaNowRadio My interview with Andy Dean on @americanowradio- I told him what I really thought about the @FoxNews debate.. 

@AmericaNowRadio I'll be on @americanowradio with Andy Dean at 6:30 ET today talking about last night's @FoxNews debate.. 

OPEC is setting crude at $94/barrel on 'signs US economy is improving. ' OPEC uses any excuse to rip us off and our leaders just watch. 

China, OPEC, Russia and Iran no longer respect us--@BarackObama's foreign policies have proved that weakness is provocative. 

China just put a tariff on US cars and trucks--22%--China is laughing at our inept leaders.  @BarackObama\. 

The lightweight, @JonHuntsman, used my name in a debate for gravitas--it didn't work.  Sad! 

A total lightweight: @JonHuntsman continues to give the worst responses on China in the debates.  I can see why (cont). 

Great @Esquiremag piece - '@DonaldJTrumpJr: What I've Learned'. 

My interview with @BarbaraJWalters in her @ABC special 'Most Fascinating People of 2011'.

Thanks to everyone who has waited in the long lines at the #TimeToGetTough book signings.  It is great to meet fellow patriots. 

So biased: @TIME made 'The Protester' as the person of the year.  @TIME celebrates OWS but vilified the Tea Party last year. 

This is what @BarackObama thinks: that America would be better off if we acted more like European socialist (cont). 

If speeches and memoirs created jobs then @BarackObama would be Ronald Reagan.

#noratings @Lawrence will soon be off tv- bad ratings- he has a face made for radio. 

"Let me put this as plainly as I know how: Iran's nuclear program must be stopped--by any and all means necessary.  Period. " #TimeToGetTough\. 

It is great to meet fellow patriots at the #TimeToGetTough book signings.  Can't wait to meet more today at Trump Tower from 12PM to 2PM\. 

The first book signing at Trump Tower for #TimeToGetTough was so popular that I'm doing another one today from noon to 2pm/Trump Tower\. 

Hope to see you tomorrow in Trump Tower (5th Ave betw 56 and 57) -- I'll be signing copies of my book #TimeToGetTough from noon until 2 pm\. 

The habitual vacationer, @BarackObama, has sacrificed so much.  He is delaying his 17 day Hawaii vacation a couple of hours. 

Iran is closing the Strait of Hormuz for a military exercise.  Imagine what they will do with nukes?! 

The Mullahs laughed when @BarackObama "asked" Iran to return our drone--they will show it to China first. 

"We have to combat the welfare mentality that says individuals are entitled to live off taxpayers. " #TimeToGetTough\. 

It has been great to meet so many wonderful people in my #TimeToGetTough book signings.  Anyone who wants to be Prez should read! 

"So, if Iran is going to take over the oil, I say we take over the oil first by hammering out a cost-sharing plan with Iraq. "#TimeToGetTough\. 

@Lawrence Read this about @lawrence....... 

My interview with @EWErickson of @RedState discussing #TimeToGetTough, GOP primary and my 2012 options. 

My @FoxNews interview with @gretawire explaining that I am keeping all my options available for 2012. 

@Rosie Save your time @rosie and focus on your horrible ratings, and don't mention my name on talk shows anymore or you will get more of the same. 

#badratings @Rosie you will never make it.  You are not funny or talented. 

#badratings @Lawrence's show failed at 8pm and is failing(even worse) at 10pm- not long for tv..... 

I feel sorry for Rosie 's new partner in love whose parents are devastated at the thought of their daughter being with @Rosie--a true loser. 

My @FoxNews interview with @TeamCavuto discussing why I will not be moderating the Newsmax-@iontv debate. 

Check out my new book  "Time To Get Tough: Making America #1 Again". 

Thousands of e-mails from folks urging me to seek the Americans Elect Presidential nomination. 

@Rosie @Lawrence #trumpvlog Same last name, same bad ratings- @lawrence and @rosie...... 

He says he will spend $1 B to get re-elected: @BarackObama.  I can match him--preserving my options. 

@timetogettough I'll be signing copies of my new book @TimeToGetTough tomorrow at Trump Tower (5th Avenue between 56 and 57) from noon to 2pm. 

Real unemployment is 20%.  We must simplify the tax code and start making our own products again to bring our jobs back from overseas. 

#trumpvlog NY Area- Two book signings- Tonight and Thursday..... 

Who handed Iraq over to Iran yesterday?  @BarackObama.  We have gotten nothing from the Iraqis-- we should have them pay us back with oil. 

#trumpvlog Why I cancelled the "great debate"...... 

Don't forget my book signing tonight at Costco on 1250 Old Country Road in Westbury, NY, from 6-8 pm.  Hope to see you there. 

The Mullahs are laughing at what they think is a very stupid president,@BarackObama has "asked" for Iran to return the drone #TimeToGetTough\. 

Look, here's  the deal: @BarackObama has been a total disaster.  He has spent this country into the ground and destroyed jobs #TimeToGetTough\. 

We need a dealmaker in the White House, who knows how to think innovatively and make smart deals.  #TimeToGetTough. 

Tonight I will be signing copies of #TimeToGetTough in Westbury at Costco, 1250 Old Country Rd, from 6 pm to 8 pm\.

I'll be signing copies of my new book #TimeToGetTough  this Thursday Dec 15th at Trump Tower (5th Ave between 56 & 57)  from noon to 2 pm. 

@BarackObama has accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 Presidents combined.  He is simply out of control. 

Why did @BarackObama let Iran keep our drone?  Now it is going straight to the Chinese.  He should have taken it out. 

I was on a tele-townhall with @TeamBachmann and hosted her 4 times in Trump Tower yet she declined the Newsmax-@iontv debate.  No loyalty. 

"Donald Trump, I think, would be fairer than a lot of the folks that have been moderating debates over the past few months. " @RickSantorum\.

The House's failure to pass the Balance Budget Amendment was another unforced error by the GOP.  Very disappointing. 

When the Super Committee fails, @BarackObama will get exactly what he really wants--automatic cuts in defense spending.  This is his plan. 

If @BarackObama wanted the "Super Committee" to succeed, he would have lead.  Instead he has been campaigning.  Where is the leadership? 

China's economy is now projected to overtake the US as the world's largest economy by 2027   #TimeToGetTough\. 

The Super Committee is finding ways to raise all our taxes without admitting it.  The Republicans made a big mistake agreeing to this deal. 

ObamaCare is one of the greatest threats our country faces.   It is unsustainable and will lead America into complete insolvency. 

@TheDailyShow @Lawrence Panama is not a Trump development.  We only manage it after it is built.  They also licensed the name.

My thoughts on Joe Paterno and political analysts in today's #trumpvlog.... 

The death tax should be abolished -- the Government is  simply taxing you twice.  It is also a job killer. 

The Debate, @BarackObama's mic, and my Endorsement in today's #trumpvlog---. 

Solyndra's government loan and subsequent bankruptcy  prove that @BarackObama is both corrupt and inept. 

The Fed should not bail out the EU.   Europe's financial mess is their problem, not our problem!

@supercommittee The @SuperCommittee will fail.  The Republicans never should have agreed to the debt deal. 

Instead of trash talking @PMIsrael on the world stage, @BarackObama should be defending @Israel. 

America should not be pressuring @Israel to show restraint against Iran.  We should be working to stop Iran's nuclear drive. 

@oWs Some @OWS protesters are sincere people frustrated with the system--others just in for the party. 

Our deficits are caused by runaway spending, not inadequate taxing.  Washington does not have a revenue problem. 

The Federal government spent over $3. 7 trillion last year.  This is unsustainable and a true danger.  The American dream is being destroyed.

Iran's quest for nuclear weapons is a major threat to our nation's national security interests.  We can't allow Iran to go nuclear. 

Malfeasance at Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac helped cause our current financial meltdown. 

@THEHermanCain My interview on @gretawire discussing the economy and @TheHermanCain "Witch Hunt". 

Watch my interview with Greta Van Susteren @gretawire tonight on Fox News at 10 p. m. 

The Oil Companies collude with OPEC to keep oil artificially overvalued.  They need to be reigned in. 

The greatest threat to our security is our debt.  It is already past 100% GDP.  We need to make real budget cuts. 

@Obamacare The economy won't fully recover until  @ObamaCare is fully repealed.  It is a job killer! 

Egypt's Muslim Brotherhood just made its first visit to Hamas-led Gaza.  Why did @BarackObama promote the "Arab Spring"? 

Why is @BarackObama letting the Taliban know when our troops are leaving?     This is dangerous for our soldiers. 

@supercommittee The  @SuperCommittee must cut spending, not raise taxes.  Washington has a spending problem, not a revenue problem. 

Another company that the DOE has given money to just filed for bankruptcy.  This is how the money we borrow at 40% from China is wasted. 

Is Jon Stewart a racist?  See video that includes clip...    #thedailyshow\.

The Debt is our nation's greatest threat.  @BarackObama is out of touch. 

@piersmorgan Watch me tonight at 9PM ET on @CNN, full hour.  @Piersmorgan won @ApprenticeNBC before taking over Larry King's slot- should be interesting. 

Why aren't we getting any oil from Iraq before we leave?  We are leaving the country wide open for Iran.  Big mistake.

The job plan by @BarackObama is nothing more than a second stimulus.  The first failed and so will this one. 

See what I have to say about Iran and Iraq in today's #trumpvlog.... 

We are leaving Iraq after expending a tremendous amount of blood and treasure.  We should be reimbursed with oil!  -- Don't give it to Iran. 

The Dollar is at an all-time WWII low against the Yen.  The Fed's recklessness is going to lead to record inflation. 

Why do we continue to sit idly by while China steals our national security and corporate secrets?  China is an enemy, not a friend. 

The Misery Index is at a 28 year high. 

Why did @BarackObama liberate Libya and do nothing for the Iranian protestors?  Iran is a threat to our national security. 

A simplified tax code will help promote growth in the private sector. 

Why did we spend billions of our money on Libya if we are not going to get any of the country's oil?  What do we get out of this? 

Why is  crude oil priced at $86/Barrel?   OPEC is  ripping us off.  Not worth $30/Barrel.   America needs new leaders. 

My thoughts on Gadhafi's death, @BarackObama, and the misery index...    #trumpvlog\.

When will @BarackObama release an actual budget? 

I don't want to be the only billionaire in America---I want all Americans to be rich. 

If the Prez wants to create jobs talk to some business people---not liberal intellectuals.

Washington is wasting over $2 billion this year on Solyndra type loans.  Yet they want to cut military spending. 

China is threatening Washington over the currency bill.   We should pass it immediately. 

@BarackObama sold guns to the Mexican drug cartels.   They were used in the murders of Americans .  Where is the outrage? 

@BarackObama now says  that he is an "underdog in 2012. " America should be so lucky.  We still need a solid candidate. 

Our national debt has grown by 30% and a gallon of gas has doubled so far under @BarackObama.  He is a disaster.

The unemployment numbers are tragic.  We are letting the world take our jobs.   It has to stop! 

@BarackObama said yesterday that we have "gone soft. " How can the world respect us when our own President doesn't? 

How many  more billions of dollars will @BarackObama continue to waste in these solar companies?

The Fed's reckless policies of low interest and flooding the market with dollars needs to be stopped or we will face record inflation. 

China does not negotiate from a position of strength, we simply negotiate against ourselves.  We have all the advantages but don't execute.

I applaud @netanyahu for announcing that he will show up at the UN to defend @Israel.  A true US friend and great leader. 

We can create jobs in the American economy by protecting our own manufacturing sector.

Friends in NY-9, let @BarackObama know that you don't approve of his mistreatment of @Israel.   Vote for @Bobturner9th tomorrow! 

The American economy would grow if Washington didn’t keep threatening higher taxes and more regulations.  Government is not the solution. 

My thoughts on @andyroddick in today's #trumpvlog..... 

Watch the 2011 #MissUniverse Pageant tonight at 9PM on NBC.... 

The World Economic Forum now ranks the US the fifth most competitive economy in the world.  We have fallen from first under @BarackObama. 

Iran’s nuclear program must be stopped – by any and all means necessary. 

Very exciting.  I will be at Macy’s Herald Square this Wednesday at 5:30pm to celebrate the launch of Trump Home crystal! 

Want jobs?  Slash corporate tax rate.   Tax incentives for companies that create jobs in US.   America will boom. 

@BarackObama---the stimulus will fail, just like the first. 

I watched POTUS speech from Europe---same old "tax and spend" won't create jobs. 

@IvankaTrump always makes me proud. 

Why is the UN planning to attack @Israel's sovereignty and ignore Iran's nuclear program?  The US should look at future funding. 

China is happy to learn that @BarackObama plans to borrow another $300 Billion.  @BarackObama is their favorite client. 

If only speeches could create jobs then @BarackObama wouldn't have such a dismal economic record. 

My interview yesterday with @IngrahamAngle. 

My interview with @gretawire last night on @FoxNews:  @BarackObama 'Missed His Opportunity'. 

America needs a tough negotiator---not a community organizer. 

Why was @BarackObama selling guns to Mexican drug dealers? 

A robust growing economy is how to fix Social Security and Medicare---not cuts on Seniors. 

US should have told Libya "Rebels" --- give us 50% of your oil for our military support. 

USA should take oil from Iraq in repayment for their liberation.. 

@BarackObama trillion $ stimulus was supposed to create jobs -- instead it gave us more debt and higher unemployment. 

The UN is about to use its Assembly to attack @Israel.  We should defund the UN entirely if they can't act resp… (cont). 

@BarackObama wishes speeches could create jobs.   His job is costing America all of ours. 

Fast and Furious   gun running goes all the way to the White House.   We need answers now! 

Oil is double the price now compared to last year--OPEC is laughing at @BarackObama. 

Fast and Furious put semi-automatics in the hands of Mexican drug lords that killed Americans - @BarackObama should answer all questions. 

The White House is predicting 9% unemployment throughout 2012 – and when Obama Care takes effect in 2014 expect it to go even higher. 

Make no mistake---Fast and Furious goes ALL the way to the White House. 

@BarackObama is so inept that I think he simply  made a mistake in originally scheduling the Joint Session on September 7th.  Just sad. 

My interview with @gretawire last night -- "Everything Obama Does is a 'Campaign Speech'". 

We must stand firm against the UN's ploy to sabotage Israel---if the UN grants the PA statehood then we must immediately defund it. 

I'll be  on Greta Van Susteren's show tonight at 10 PM on FoxNews.  Tune in. 

With gas prices rising and the economy failing,  @BarackObama seeks to have his EPA raise energy prices by $109B. 

Libya is being taken over by Islamic radicals---with @BarackObama's open support. 

My thoughts on Dick Cheney and his new book…   #trumpvlog\. 

@BarackObama transparently had ATF head Kenneth Melson resign yesterday.... Fast and Furious obviously goes all the way to the White House. 

China's business interests reach far and wide---even domestically within our borders.  We need to reassess our relationship. 

The new Libyan Government should turn over the Lockerbie bomber---now. 

ObamaCare must be fully repealed or it will destroy America's small businesses. 

If the UN unilaterally grants the Palestinians statehood, then the US should cut off all its funding.  Actions have consequences. 

If the Palestinians want statehood then why are they run by the terrorist group Hamas? 

Crude is at $85 right now – isn’t even worth half that.  OPEC is ripping us off. 

@BarackObama MUST release a budget before @johnboehner begins negotiations on a continuing appropriations resolution. 

Iran admits to aiding the Libyan "Rebels" and Ahmadinejad received a letter of thanks - when will Washington learn?. 

Libyan Rebels should have given us 50% of the oil in return for our military support---we don't even ask! 

Hurricane Irene and Libya in today's #trumpvlog..... 

More and more Americans seem fed up with both Parties----I agree. 

There is no substitute for private sector experience. 

Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard?  They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime. 

@EricTrumpFdn I'm very proud of the work my son @EricTrump has been doing with the @EricTrumpFDN, take a look.... 

America needs a President who can negotiate better deals for the American People. 

China's corporate espionage is a continued threat to the American economy.  With the right leadership, it can be stopped. 

@BarackObama inherited $10. 6 Trillion in National Debt---will leave after his first term with the Debt at over $17. 6 Trillion. 

There usually is an easy solution to every problem.  For instance, a lot of our country's problems can be solved in next year's election. 

We have spent over $1 Billion on the  Libya operation.  What are we getting back? 

Just as I predicted, @Joe_Biden was a complete disaster in China.  He condoned the Chinese one-child policy an… (cont). 

As bad as Qaddafi was---what comes next in Libya will be worse---just watch. 

Let's not start celebrating over Libya until we see who takes over. 

We  spent over a billion on Libya and lead the way---why is Europe getting the oil? 

@RonPaul has some serious ideas which deserve serious consideration.  Wrong for media to ignore him. 

We don't need another stimulus.  The first one was a complete failure.  Why repeat the same mistake? 

We should have told the so-called rebels “We will only help if you give us 50% of your oil. ”   #trumpvlog\. 

While @BarackObama continues to defend ObamaCare in the courts, he is also granting companies waivers.  Eve… (cont). 

Israel is being barraged by rockets from Gaza recently.  They must respond accordingly in defense of their citizens. 

@BarackObama is sure a master delegator.  He has sent @Joe_Biden to China.  The Chinese are laughing at us.  We MUST do better. 

@BarackObama’s new job plan will certainly do the following – 1.  Not create any jobs.  2.  Borrow more money from China.  

@12pm You can listen to my interview today with Jay Sekulow Live and the @JordanSekulow show here   @12PM EST. 

Insurgents in Iraq show they can still mount horrifying attacks---US wastes  trillions. 

Many people have been asking to see my plane, The Apprentice's @AmandaTMiller will give you a tour.... 

Karl Rove --lost GOP both Houses of Congress and the White House--gave us Obama. 

@MacMiller will enjoy today's #trumpvlog.... 

Ron Paul is right when he says we are wasting lives and money in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

My interview with @gretawire on Fox News for those who missed it - 'Obama's Constantly on Vacation'. 

@BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating.  Why so high? 

My interview this morning on Good Morning America  with George Stephanopoulos. 

Rush, Sean Hannity, Mike Savage, Greta Van Susteren and Bill O'Reilly---my personal favorites. 

Amazing--Obama speaks, market goes  DOWN---Trump tells CNBC he's buying stock---market goes UP --- should not be that way! 

China owes us money....    #trumpvlog\. 

A good example of how our country wastes money...    #trumpvlog\. 

I was interviewed by Greta Van Susteren today here at Trump Tower.   Tune in tonight on Fox News at 10 p. m. … (cont). 

China is a threat to America.  They are not our friend. 

Unemployment is plaguing both Black and Hispanic youths.  Very troubling. 

My thoughts on the Republican Party in today's #trumpvlog.... 

@BarackObama played golf yesterday.  Now he  heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard.   Nice work ethic. 

Reporters say it's the Trump Bump---I tell CNBC I am buying stocks--- and the market goes up. 

Economic growth can save Social Security, Medicare and America. 

Mike Huckebee, a great guy, said the President should appoint me Treasury Secretary.  China and OPEC would not be happy. 

Ron Paul is right that we are wasting trillions of dollars in Iraq and Afghanistan. 

Obama has no understanding of how to create jobs or opportunity.  He believes in Government. 

My interview on @AmericaNowRadio with Andy Dean.  Andy was a contestant on the second season of The Apprentic… (cont). 

It's easy to see why Americans are sick of career politicians and both parties. 

How will Mitt Romney defend his  record on jobs and Romneycare in tonight's debate? 

Looking forward to the GOP  debate and the outcome of the Ames straw poll.  We must get a real leader. 

I was on CNBC this morning talking about the market and America's financial future. 

My interview from yesterday with #Apprentice Andy on @AmericaNowRadio. 

The Fed continues to flood the market with US dollars.  Wrong move. 

Oil is starting to rise again despite the horrible times.  OPEC continues to rip us off.  Not worth $30.  New leadership needed. 

Congress should get back to Washington, but @BarackObama doesn't want to interrupt his vacation in Martha's Vineyard. 

@BarackObama took another swipe at the State of Israel for building in their capital Jerusalem on a Jewish hol… (cont). 

Listen in live NOW to the new radio show@AmericaNowRadio as my #Apprentice Andy and I tell it like it is 6PMET. 

  Countdown to @AmericaNowRadio as my former#Apprentice Andy and I talk about politics an… (cont).

The S&P are losers.  They did this for personal publicity in order to straighten out their terrible reputatio… (cont). 

My interview yesterday on the S&P downgrade with Wolf Blitzer on CNN. 

My interview with Greta last night on Fox News -- "Nation Has Become "All Talk, No Action' ". 

He's hired!  Listen to my #Apprentice Andy launchhis radio show @AmericaNowRadio with me tomorrow 6PM ET. 

The S&P downgrade is a direct result of @BarackObama's increased reckless budget spending and Obama Care.  He owns this. 

The new President of OPEC is Mahmoud Ahmadinejad’s confidant Rostam Ghasemi, a commander of the Revolutionar… (cont). 

Obama Care is already having a devastating impact on our economy. 

In today's #trumpvlog I answer your questions about what you should be doing in this uncertain economy.... 

China demanded that we raise our debt ceiling and then their rating agency downgraded us.  Our leaders are hope… (cont). 

America's debt officially became 100% of our GDP on @BarackObama's 50th birthday---coincidence? 

My interview last night with Greta on Fox News. 

Thanks to Giovanni's Coal Fire Pizza of Florida for donating enough pizza to feed 750 Police Athletic League youngsters in NY this Friday. 

Watch my interview with Greta Van Susteren on her show, On the Record, tonight on Fox News in the 10 p. m.  hour. 

Today's #trumpvlog answers your tweets about my thoughts on the Republican candidates.... 

Morning Joe Panel is stealing many of  my statements and ideas to better America without giving credit -- the story of my life! 

Republicans gave Obama a free pass to the White House -- they just don't get it. 

I believe America can be great only with proper leadership. 

Wake Up America -- China is eating our lunch. 

All those politicians in Washington and not one good negotiator. 

Why I would not have approved the deal...    #trumpvlog\. 

No taxes the only good thing about DC Debt Deal. 

      My  interview yesterday on CNBC's Squawk Box:  Debt Deal a… (cont). 

The more you learn about the debt deal, the worse it gets. 

Your questions about my desk answered in today's #trumpvlog.... 

Republicans and Democrats have both created our economic problems. 

How does this deal help strengthen the US? 

Why should we have any defense cuts in any deal?  America must remain strong. 

This is the best deal the Republicans could get? 

Disappointed in GOP and Dems---Giving Obama power to raise the debt limit next year is  a mistake. 

Ex-Presidential Pollster Pat Cadell says most voters sick of both parties and their failure. 

We need economic growth and jobs not blue ribbon panels to study the problem. 

No taxes in Boehner or Reid Plan----important victory for America. 

Watched Sean Hannity last night -- a great guy. 

If Obama has to re-fight this fight next year he loses  -- "Watch the fine details in every deal" -- The Art of the Deal\. 

Blue Ribbon Commission to find and agree to future spending cuts?  Bad idea. 

"Never quit and always hit back" -- The Art of the Comeback\. 

I just got Mike Leach's new book,  Swing Your Sword.  He's a great coach, and he's written a great book.  It's definitely worth reading. 

I appreciate the kind words of Mike Huckabee, a fine American. 

@BarackObama has not released his own debt plan yet.  He's totally lost, ineffective, desperate.  GOP has its best chance to make a great deal\. 

My wife Melania Trump's show was a tremendous success last night.  In case you missed her, you can see her again tonight on @QVC at 7 pm ET\. 

@Johnboehner  "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. "  --The Art of the Deal\. 

Please tweet me your questions to answer in my #trumpvlog. 

@KarlRove's @CrossroadsGPS new ad criticizes Obama for his excessive spending and debt, borrowing from China.  Didn't Bush do the same thing? 

My interview yesterday from Newsmax - "Obama Is  'Now Totally Lost,'  Boehner Must Not Fold". 

People ask me every day to pose for pictures but the camera never works the first time--they are never prepared or maybe just very nervous! 

"Know when to walk away from the table. "   The Art of the Deal\. 

Watch my wife Melania Trump tonight on @QVC at 1 a. m.   So proud of her! 

Higher Taxes kill job creation---cut wild government spending and waste. 

China has so much of our debt that they can't put us in default w/o killing themselves---US needs our toughest negotiator---and fast! 

America's debt is greater than our GDP.  Time for new thinking. 

My interview from yesterday on Fox and Friends -- "GOP Crazy If  They Don't Get Everything They  Want". 

My thoughts on the situation in Norway and Amanda Knox...    #trumpvlog\. 

Fiscal mismanagement of cash costing US Taxpayer billions---cut fraud and waste before cutting funding for Seniors. 

Obama, sadly, has no business or private sector background---and it shows. 

The pressure on the debt ceiling is on @BarackObama....    #trumpvlog\. 

The Answer to both Social Security and Medicare is a robust growing economy---not cuts on the elderly. 

We need a balanced budget Amendment because Congress has no fiscal discipline. 

Unfortunately@BarackObama's continued attack on the US $ will lead to ever rising gas prices at the pump and lots of other really bad things\. 

Ronald Kessler's new book "The Secrets of the FBI" is a great book that should be read by everyone. 

"Increasing America’s debt weakens us domestically and internationally. " - US Senator @BarackObama, 2007\. 

My interview on @gretawire last night  - "Our Leaders Are Leading Us Into 'Oblivion'". 

"The Gang of Six" - yet another unmitigated disaster.  ANY DEAL NEEDS TO REPEAL OBAMACARE.  T-E-A. 

We could use the Balanced Budget Amendment--Politicians don't have the will to cut spending. 

"China is our enemy--they want to destroy us" -- Redstate Interview\. 

Obama is addicted to spending America into insolvency.  His record proves it. 

Robust Economic growth is the answer to the Medicare Problem--not cuts on the elderly. 

Check out. 

  Obamacare is The Biggest Tax Increase In U. S.  History--repeal it as part of any deal. 

While @BarackObama seeks to further destroy  our credit, our economy continues to hemorrhage jobs.  Such a total failure---as a President. 

@johnboehner  @EricCantor  "You can't con people... if you don't deliver the goods, people will eventually catch on. " - The Art of the Deal\. 

So China is ordering us to raise the Debt Limit... How low have we as a nation sunk? 

The GOP doesn't waste  an opportunity to waste an opportunity.  Defunding Obamacare should be central to any deal. 

Every dollar @BarackObama spends costs $1. 40 with interest borrowed from China on our children and grandchildren's backs.  CUT-CAP-BALANCE! 

@BarackObama has sold guns to Mexican drug lords while his DOJ erodes our 2nd  Amendment rights. 

@BarackObama #trumpvlog The Republicans must act now, don't let @barackobama push you around..... 

Congratulations to my daughter Ivanka and her husband Jared on the birth of  their daughter Arabella Rose yesterday. 

@marcorubio is right.  We need to create more taxpayers, not more taxes.  CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.. 

@BarackObama You have increased discretionary spending by 25% annually and amassed over $4 trillion in debt.  T-E-A. 

Who will be the next @TheRealTeenUSA?  Find out this Saturday at 8PM ET on missteenusa. com  #TeenUSA\. 

What is better advice- "The Art of the Deal" or "Rules for Radicals"?  I know which one @BarackObama prefers. 

CUT, CAP AND BALANCE.  TAXED ENOUGH ALREADY! 

Take a look at    and    to see these beautiful hotels. 

US News named the Top10 best hotels in the US--and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower NYC and Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower Chicago are on the list! 

@BarackObama You have abandoned Israel and engaged the Muslim Brotherhood, and even the Arab world does not like it. 

While @BarackObama tries to push gun control   --He still has not answered for Project Gun Runner. 

My interview last night with Greta on the GOP going El Foldo. 

@johnboehner Debt Ceiling- "Sometimes no deal is better than a bad deal. "

More thoughts on the debt ceiling in today's #trumpvlog.... 

@MacMiller @macmiller "Donald Trump the Song" gets 16M hits on YouTube.  Who wouldn't be flattered? 

@johnboehner "Much as it pays to emphasize the positive, there are times when the only choice is confrontation. "  The Art of the Deal\. 

@johnboehner Mr.  Speaker, bring the Balanced Budget Amendment to the floor for a vote!  Let's get the ball rolling. 

On our YouTube channel- the opening of the incredible Trump Ocean Club in Panama..... 

Derek Jeter's baseball and more in today's #trumpvlog.... 

House GOP wants to cut Medicare, Obama took $500 billion from Medicare for Obamacare.  Both Wrong! 

@obama ObamaCare Tragedy Primed to Further Explode the Deficit     And @Obama transferred $500 billion from Medicare to fund it! 

@obama @Obama - Iranian weapons killing Americans in Iraq?  What are u doing about this?. 

@johnboehner Message for House GOP  "The worst thing you can possibly do in a deal is seem desperate to make it. " - The Art of the Deal. 

@obama If only @Obama was as focused on balancing the budget as he is on weakening Israel's borders then America would be on the path to solvency. 

THe Art of the Deal--"The best thing you can do is deal from strength, and leverage is the biggest strength you have. " CUT, CAP and BALANCE. 

Republicans should not negotiate against themselves again with @BarackObama in today's debt talks--First and foremost CUT,CAP and BALANCE. 

Congress is back. TIME TO CUT, CAP AND BALANCE. There is no revenue problem. The Debt Limit cannot be raised until Obama spending is contained. 

Perhaps this is the kind of thinking we need in Washington .... 

Tomorrow we'll be going to Panama for the opening of our new hotel.  It's a fantastic building in a fantastic location.. 

Wishing everyone a wonderful Independence Day holiday weekend, a great celebration for a great country.
