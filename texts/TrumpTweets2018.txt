Our Great Larry Kudlow, who has been working so hard on trade and the economy, has just suffered a heart attack.  He is now in Walter Reed Medical Center. 

Just won big Supreme Court decision on Voting!  Great News! 

The fact that I am having a meeting is a major loss for the U. S. , say the haters & losers.  We have our hostages, testing, research and all missle launches have stoped, and these pundits, who have called me wrong from the beginning, have nothing else they can say!  We will be fine! 

Stock Market up almost 40% since the Election, with 7 Trillion Dollars of U. S.  value built throughout the economy.  Lowest unemployment rate in many decades, with Black & Hispanic unemployment lowest in History, and Female unemployment lowest in 21 years.  Highest confidence ever! 

Meetings between staffs and representatives are going well and quickly.... but in the end, that doesn’t matter.  We will all know soon whether or not a real deal, unlike those of the past, can happen! 

Thank you Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong!. 

Sorry, we cannot let our friends, or enemies, take advantage of us on Trade anymore.  We must put the American worker first! 

Great to be in Singapore, excitement in the air! 

.... Germany pays 1% (slowly) of GDP towards NATO, while we pay 4% of a MUCH larger GDP.  Does anybody believe that makes sense?  We protect Europe (which is good) at great financial loss, and then get unfairly clobbered on Trade.  Change is coming! 

.... And add to that the fact that the U. S.  pays close to the entire cost of NATO-protecting many of these same countries that rip us off on Trade (they pay only a fraction of the cost-and laugh! ).  The European Union had a $151 Billion Surplus-should pay much more for Military! 

Why should I, as President of the United States, allow countries to continue to make Massive Trade Surpluses, as they have for decades, while our Farmers, Workers & Taxpayers have such a big and unfair price to pay?  Not fair to the PEOPLE of America!  $800 Billion Trade Deficit... 

Fair Trade is now to be called Fool Trade if it is not Reciprocal.  According to a Canada release, they make almost 100 Billion Dollars in Trade with U. S.  (guess they were bragging and got caught! ).  Minimum is 17B.  Tax Dairy from us at 270%.  Then Justin acts hurt when called out! 

@g7 PM Justin Trudeau of Canada acted so meek and mild during our @G7 meetings only to give a news conference after I left saying that, “US Tariffs were kind of insulting” and he “will not be pushed around. ” Very dishonest & weak.  Our Tariffs are in response to his of 270% on dairy! 

Based on Justin’s false statements at his news conference, and the fact that Canada is charging massive Tariffs to our U. S.  farmers, workers and companies, I have instructed our U. S.  Reps not to endorse the Communique as we look at Tariffs on automobiles flooding the U. S.  Market! 

…Create peace and great prosperity for his land.  I look forward to meeting him and have a feeling that this one-time opportunity will not be wasted! 

I am on my way to Singapore where we have a chance to achieve a truly wonderful result for North Korea and the World.  It will certainly be an exciting day and I know that Kim Jong-un will work very hard to do something that has rarely been done before... 

The United States will not allow other countries to impose massive Tariffs and Trade Barriers on its farmers, workers and companies.  While sending their product into our country tax free.  We have put up with Trade Abuse for many decades — and that is long enough. 

... U. S. A.  Trade.  They fully understand where I am coming from.  After many decades, fair and reciprocal Trade will happen! 

@g7 Just left the @G7 Summit in beautiful Canada.  Great meetings and relationships with the six Country Leaders especially since they know I cannot allow them to apply large Tariffs and strong barriers to... 

Just met the new Prime Minister of Italy, @GiuseppeConteIT, a really great guy.  He will be honored in Washington, at the @WhiteHouse, shortly.  He will do a great job - the people of Italy got it right! 

Henry McMaster loves the people of South Carolina and was with me from the beginning.  He is strong on Crime and Borders, great for our Military and our Vets.  He is doing a fantastic job as your Governor, and has my full endorsement, a special guy.  Vote on Tuesday! 

@g7 . @G7 Press Briefing in Charlevoix, Canada, prior to departing for Singapore!. 

My thoughts and prayers are with the families of our serviceman who was killed and his fellow servicemen who were wounded in Somalia.  They are truly all HEROES. 

I am heading for Canada and the G-7 for talks that will mostly center on the long time unfair trade practiced against the United States.  From there I go to Singapore and talks with North Korea on Denuclearization.  Won’t be talking about the Russian Witch Hunt Hoax for a while! 

Congratulations to the Washington Capitals on their GREAT play and winning the Stanley Cup Championship.  Alex Ovechkin, the team captain, was spectacular - a true Superstar!  D. C.  is popping, in many ways.  What a time! 

Looking forward to straightening out unfair Trade Deals with the G-7 countries.  If it doesn’t happen, we come out even better! 

Canada charges the U. S.  a 270%  tariff on Dairy Products!  They didn’t tell you that, did they?  Not fair to our farmers! 

Obama, Schumer and Pelosi did NOTHING about North Korea, and now weak on Crime, High Tax Schumer is telling me what to do at the Summit the Dems could never set up.  Schumer failed with North Korea and Iran, we don’t need his advice! 

Why isn’t the European Union and Canada informing the public that for years they have used massive Trade Tariffs and non-monetary Trade Barriers against the U. S.  Totally unfair to our farmers, workers & companies.  Take down your tariffs & barriers or we will more than match you! 

Prime Minister Trudeau is being so indignant, bringing up the relationship that the U. S.  and Canada had over the many years and all sorts of other things... but he doesn’t bring up the fact that they charge us up to 300% on dairy — hurting our Farmers, killing our Agriculture! 

Please tell Prime Minister Trudeau and President Macron that they are charging the U. S.  massive tariffs and create non-monetary barriers.  The EU trade surplus with the U. S.  is $151 Billion, and Canada keeps our farmers and others out.  Look forward to seeing them tomorrow. 

Great day of meetings with Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan!. 

PM Abe and I are also working to improve the trading relationship between the U. S.  and Japan, something we have to do.  The U. S.  seeks a bilateral deal with Japan that is based on the principle of fairness and reciprocity.  We’re working hard to reduce our trade imbalance.... 

Today, I am greatly honored to welcome my good friend, PM Abe of Japan to the @WhiteHouse.  Over the past 16 months the Prime Minister and I have worked closely together to address common challenges, of which there are many.... 

It’s my great honor to welcome Prime Minister @AbeShinzo back to the @WhiteHouse! <Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of Japan>. 

“$3 billion payoff: 101 utilities cut rates, credit GOP tax cuts”. 

“Total jobless claims running at lowest level in 44 years”. 

MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

The Obama Administration is now accused of trying to give Iran secret access to the financial system of the United States.  This is totally illegal.  Perhaps we could get the 13 Angry Democrats to divert some of their energy to this “matter” (as Comey would call it).  Investigate! 

When will people start saying, “thank you, Mr.  President, for firing James Comey? ”

Our Justice Department must not let Awan & Debbie Wasserman Schultz off the hook.  The Democrat I. T.  scandal is a key to much of the corruption we see today.  They want to make a “plea deal” to hide what is on their Server.  Where is Server?  Really bad! 

Looking forward to seeing my friend Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan at noon.  Will be discussing North Korea and Trade. 

How could Jeff Flake, who is setting record low polling numbers in Arizona and was therefore humiliatingly forced out of his own Senate seat without even a fight (and who doesn’t have a clue), think about running for office, even a lower one, again?  Let’s face it, he’s a Flake! 

When and where will all of the many conflicts of interest be listed by the 13 Angry Democrats (plus) working on the Witch Hunt Hoax.  There has never been a group of people on a case so biased or conflicted.  It is all a Democrat Excuse for LOSING the Election.  Where is the server? 

Alan Dershowitz, Harvard Law Professor: “It all proves that we never needed a Special Counsel.... All of this could have been done by the Justice Dept.  Don’t need a multi-million dollar group of people with a target on someone’s back.  Not the way Justice should operate. ” So true! 

Good luck to Alice Johnson.  Have a wonderful life! 

Isn’t it Ironic?  Getting ready to go to the G-7 in Canada to fight for our country on Trade (we have the worst trade deals ever made), then off to Singapore to meet with North Korea & the Nuclear Problem... But back home we still have the 13 Angry Democrats pushing the Witch Hunt! 

@fema Thank you to everyone at @FEMA HQ for today’s briefing on preparations for the upcoming hurricane season.  Disaster response and recovery is best achieved when it’s federally supported, state managed, and locally executed – this is the successful model we will continue to build.. 

We must always protect those who protect us.  Today, it was my great honor to sign the #VAMissionAct and to make Veterans Choice the permanent law of the land!. 

Today we mark another milestone: the 74th anniversary of #DDay, the Allied invasion of Normandy.  On June 6, 1944, more than 70,000 brave young Americans charged out of landing craft, jumped out of airplanes, and stormed into hell.... 

Congratulations to Dana Rohrabacher on his big California win.  We are proud of you Dana! 

Many more Republican voters showed up yesterday than the Fake News thought possible.  The political pundits just don’t get what is going on out there - or they do get it but refuse to report the facts!  Remember, Dems are High Tax, High Crime, easy to beat! 

... Four reporters spotted Melania in the White House last week walking merrily along to a meeting.  They never reported the sighting because it would hurt the sick narrative that she was living in a different part of the world, was really ill, or whatever.  Fake News is really bad! 

The Fake News Media has been so unfair, and vicious, to my wife and our great First Lady, Melania.  During her recovery from surgery they reported everything from near death, to facelift, to left the W. H.  (and me) for N. Y.  or Virginia, to abuse.  All Fake, she is doing really well! 

Gold Star father, Ceejay Metcalf, whose great son Michael was just honored at the White House, was fantastic this morning on @foxandfriends.  He is a special man! 

Great night for Republicans!  Congratulations to John Cox on a really big number in California.  He can win.  Even Fake News CNN said the Trump impact was really big, much bigger than they ever thought possible.  So much for the big Blue Wave, it may be a big Red Wave.  Working hard! 

Mitch McConnell announced he will cancel the Senate’s August Recess.  Great, maybe the Democrats will finally get something done other than their acceptance of High Crime and High Taxes.  We need Border Security! 

.... The greatest Witch Hunt in political history! 

... This is a level of criminality beyond the pale.  This is such a grave abuse of power and authority, it’s like nothing else we’ve seen in our history.  This makes the Nixon Watergate burglary look like keystone cop stuff\. 

Chris Farrell, Judicial Watch.  “They were running an operation to undermine a candidate for President of the U. S.  These are all violations of law.  This is intelligence tradecraft to steer an election.  There’s nothing more grave when it comes to abuse of our intelligence system... 

Great interview by @LouDobbs with Chris Farrell of Judicial Watch concerning the governments counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign.  SPYGATE at the highest level.  Who would believe? 

Wow, Strzok-Page, the incompetent & corrupt FBI lovers, have texts referring to a counter-intelligence operation into the Trump Campaign dating way back to December, 2015.  SPYGATE is in full force!  Is the Mainstream Media interested yet?  Big stuff! 

. 

Imagine how much wasteful spending we’d save if we didn’t have Chuck and Nancy standing in our way!  For years, Democrats in Congress have depleted our military and busted our budgets on needless spending, and to what end?  No more. 

The HISTORIC Rescissions Package we’ve proposed would cut $15,000,000,000 in Wasteful Spending!  We are getting our government back on track. 

Terrific new book out by the wonderful Harris Faulkner, “9 Rules of Engagement. ” Harris shares lessons from a military family.  Enjoy! 

Senator @RogerWicker of Mississippi has done everything necessary to Make America Great Again!  Get out and vote for Roger, he has my total support! 

Vote for Congressman Devin Nunes, a true American Patriot the likes of which we rarely see in our modern day world.... he truly loves our country and deserves everyone’s support! 

Get the vote out in California today for Rep.  Kevin McCarthy and all of the great GOP candidates for Congress.  Keep our country out of the hands of High Tax, High Crime Nancy Pelosi. 

In High Tax, High Crime California, be sure to get out and vote for Republican John Cox for Governor.  He will make a BIG difference! 

Separating families at the Border is the fault of bad legislation passed by the Democrats.  Border Security laws should be changed but the Dems can’t get their act together!  Started the Wall. 

.... @NASCAR and Champion @MartinTruex_Jr were recently at the White House.  It was a great day for a great sport! 

Meeting in Singapore with North Korea will hopefully be the start of something big... we will soon see! 

The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax continues, all because Jeff Sessions didn’t tell me he was going to recuse himself... I would have quickly picked someone else.  So much time and money wasted, so many lives ruined... and Sessions knew better than most that there was No Collusion! 

We have had many Championship teams recently at the White House including the Chicago Cubs, Houston Astros, Pittsburgh Penguins, New England Patriots, Alabama and Clemson National Champions, and many others.  National Anthem & more great music today at 3:00 P. M. 

We will proudly be playing the National Anthem and other wonderful music celebrating our Country today at 3 P. M. , The White House, with the United States Marine Band and the United States Army Chorus.  Honoring America!  NFL, no escaping to Locker Rooms! 

The U. S.  has an increased economic value of more than 7 Trillion Dollars since the Election.  May be the best economy in the history of our country.  Record Jobs numbers.  Nice! 

What is taking so long with the Inspector General’s Report on Crooked Hillary and Slippery James Comey.  Numerous delays.  Hope Report is not being changed and made weaker!  There are so many horrible things to tell, the public has the right to know.  Transparency! 

In many ways this is the greatest economy in the HISTORY of America and the best time EVER to look for a job! 

The Fake News Media is desperate to distract from the economy and record setting economic numbers and so they keep talking about the phony Russian Witch Hunt. 

#500Days of American Greatness. 

The appointment of the Special Counsel is totally UNCONSTITUTIONAL!  Despite that, we play the game because I, unlike the Democrats, have done nothing wrong! 

Farmers have not been doing well for 15 years.  Mexico, Canada, China and others have treated them unfairly.  By the time I finish trade talks, that will change.  Big trade barriers against U. S.  farmers, and other businesses, will finally be broken.  Massive trade deficits no longer! 

The U. S.  has made such bad trade deals over so many years that we can only WIN! 

China already charges a tax of 16% on soybeans.  Canada has all sorts of trade barriers on our Agricultural products.  Not acceptable! 

As has been stated by numerous legal scholars, I have the absolute right to PARDON myself, but why would I do that when I have done nothing wrong?  In the meantime, the never ending Witch Hunt, led by 13 very Angry and Conflicted Democrats (& others) continues into the mid-terms! 

“This is the best time EVER to look for a job. ” James Freeman of WSJ. 

.... We had Repeal & Replace done (and the saving to our country of one trillion dollars) except for one person, but it is getting done anyway.  Individual Mandate is gone and great, less expensive plans will be announced this month.  Drug prices coming down & Right to Try! 

This is my 500th.  Day in Office and we have accomplished a lot - many believe more than any President in his first 500 days.  Massive Tax & Regulation Cuts, Military & Vets, Lower Crime & Illegal Immigration, Stronger Borders, Judgeships, Best Economy & Jobs EVER, and much more... 

Mark Penn  “Why are there people from the Clinton Foundation on the Mueller Staff?  Why is there an Independent Counsel?  To go after people and their families for unrelated offenses... Constitution was set up to prevent this... Stormtrooper tactics almost. ” A disgrace! 

.... Paul Manafort came into the campaign very late and was with us for a short period of time (he represented Ronald Reagan, Bob Dole & many others over the years), but we should have been told that Comey and the boys were doing a number on him, and he wouldn’t have been hired! 

As only one of two people left who could become President, why wouldn’t the FBI or Department of “Justice” have told me that they were secretly investigating Paul Manafort (on charges that were 10 years old and had been previously dropped) during my campaign?  Should have told me! 

Jesse Watters “The only thing Trump obstructed was Hillary getting to the White House. ”  So true! 

When you’re almost 800 Billion Dollars a year down on Trade, you can’t lose a Trade War!  The U. S.  has been ripped off by other countries for years on Trade, time to get smart! 

Why is it that the Wall Street Journal, though well meaning, never mentions the unfairness of the Tariffs routinely charged against the U. S.  by other countries, or the many Billions of Dollars that the Tariffs we are now charging are, and will be, pouring into U. S.  coffers? 

The United States must, at long last, be treated fairly on Trade.  If we charge a country ZERO to sell their goods, and they charge us 25, 50 or even 100 percent to sell ours, it is UNFAIR and can no longer be tolerated.  That is not Free or Fair Trade, it is Stupid Trade! 

There was No Collusion with Russia (except by the Democrats).  When will this very expensive Witch Hunt Hoax ever end?  So bad for our Country.  Is the Special Counsel/Justice Department leaking my lawyers letters to the Fake News Media?  Should be looking at Dems corruption instead? 

Real @FoxNews is doing great, Fake News CNN is dead!. 

Very surprised that China would be doing this?. 

. 

Now this is a record that will never be broken!. 

.... “$17 million spent, it’s a scam Investigation.  Americans are being worked.  We now know there was Russian collusion, with Russians and the Democrats.  The Mueller team is stacked with anti-Trumpers, who actually represented Clinton people (& gave $’s to Crooked H). ” Dan Bongino\. 

“John Brennan, no single figure in American history has done more to discredit the intelligence community than this liar.  Not only is he a liar, he’s a liar about being a liar. ”  Dan Bongino on @foxandfriends\. 

“We ran out of words to describe how good the jobs numbers are. ”  Neil Irwin of the @nytimes. 

Today, it was my great honor to be with the brave men and women of the United States Coast Guard!. 

Canada has treated our Agricultural business and Farmers very poorly for a very long period of time.  Highly restrictive on Trade!  They must open their markets and take down their trade barriers!  They report a really high surplus on trade with us.  Do Timber & Lumber in U. S.? 

Looking forward to seeing the employment numbers at 8:30 this morning. 

Why aren’t they firing no talent Samantha Bee for the horrible language used on her low ratings show?  A total double standard but that’s O. K. , we are Winning, and will be doing so for a long time to come! 

A. P.  has just reported that the Russian Hoax Investigation has now cost our government over $17 million, and going up fast.  No Collusion, except by the Democrats! 

FAIR TRADE! 

Will be giving a Full Pardon to Dinesh D’Souza today.  He was treated very unfairly by our government! 

Very good meetings with North Korea. 

Not that it matters but I never fired James Comey because of Russia!  The Corrupt Mainstream Media loves to keep pushing that narrative, but they know it is not true! 

The corrupt Mainstream Media is working overtime not to mention the infiltration of people, Spies (Informants), into my campaign!  Surveillance much? 

Iger, where is my call of apology?  You and ABC have offended millions of people, and they demand a response.  How is Brian Ross doing?  He tanked the market with an ABC lie, yet no apology.  Double Standard! 

RUSH LIMBAUGH  “If the FBI was so concerned, and if they weren’t targeting Trump, they should have told Trump.  If they were really concerned about the Russians infiltrating a campaign (hoax), then why not try to stop it?  Why not tell Trump?  Because they were pushing this scam. ”

“The recusal of Jeff Sessions was an unforced betrayal of the President of the United States. ” JOE DIGENOVA, former U. S.  Attorney. 

The soon to be released book, “The Russia Hoax, The Illicit Scheme To Clear Hillary Clinton And Frame Donald Trump,” written by Gregg Jarrett, looks like a real deal big hit.  The Phony Witch Hunt will be opened up for the world to see!  Out in 5 weeks. 

Very importantly, @RepDanDonovan will win for the Republicans in November... and his opponent will not.  Remember Alabama.  We can’t take any chances on losing to a Nancy Pelosi controlled Democrat! 

There is no one better to represent the people of N. Y.  and Staten Island (a place I know very well) than @RepDanDonovan, who is strong on Borders & Crime, loves our Military & our Vets, voted for Tax Cuts and is helping me to Make America Great Again.  Dan has my full endorsement! 

Great meeting with @KimKardashian today, talked about prison reform and sentencing.. 

Moments ago, it was my great honor to sign #RightToTry into law!. 

With the #RightToTry Law I signed today, patients with life threatening illnesses will finally have access to experimental treatments that could improve or even cure their conditions.  These are experimental treatments and products that have shown great promise.... 

Today I am proud to keep another promise to the American people as I sign the #RightToTry Legislation into law.. 

Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that “ABC does not tolerate comments like those” made by Roseanne Barr.  Gee, he never called President Donald J.  Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC.  Maybe I just didn’t get the call? 

The Failing and Corrupt @nytimes estimated the crowd last night at “1000 people,” when in fact it was many times that number - and the arena was rockin’.  This is the way they demean and disparage.  They are very dishonest people who don’t “get” me, and never did! 

.... There are lots of really good lawyers in the country, he could have picked somebody else! ” And I wish I did! 

.... chief law enforcement officer, and they told me later, ‘oh by the way I’m not going to be able to participate in the most important case in the office, I would be frustrated too... and that’s how I read that - Senator Sessions, why didn’t you tell me before I picked you..... 

Rep. Trey Gowdy, “I don’t think so, I think what the President is doing is expressing frustration that Attorney General Sessions should have shared these reasons for recusal before he took the job, not afterward.  If I were the President and I picked someone to be the country’s.... 

The Fake Mainstream Media has, from the time I announced I was running for President, run the most highly sophisticated & dishonest Disinformation Campaign in the history of politics.  No matter how well WE do, they find fault.  But the forgotten men & women WON, I’m President! 

Sorry, I’ve got to start focusing my energy on North Korea Nuclear, bad Trade Deals, VA Choice, the Economy, rebuilding the Military, and so much more, and not on the Rigged Russia Witch Hunt that should be investigating Clinton/Russia/FBI/Justice/Obama/Comey/Lynch etc. 

Why aren’t the 13 Angry and heavily conflicted Democrats investigating the totally Crooked Campaign of totally Crooked Hillary Clinton.  It’s a Rigged Witch Hunt, that’s why!  Ask them if they enjoyed her after election celebration! 

The 13 Angry Democrats (plus people who worked 8 years for Obama) working on the rigged Russia Witch Hunt, will be MEDDLING with the mid-term elections, especially now that Republicans (stay tough! ) are taking the lead in Polls.  There was no Collusion, except by the Democrats! 

“This investigation involved far more surveillance than we ever had any idea about.  It wasn’t just a wiretap against a campaign aide... it was secretly gathering information on the Trump Campaign... people call that Spying... this is unprecedented and  scandalous. ” Mollie Hemingway\. 

We have put a great team together for our talks with North Korea.  Meetings are currently taking place concerning Summit, and more.  Kim Young Chol, the Vice Chairman of North Korea, heading now to New York.  Solid response to my letter, thank you! 

Democrats mistakenly tweet 2014 pictures from Obama’s term showing children from the Border in steel cages.  They thought it was recent pictures in order to make us look bad, but backfires.  Dems must agree to Wall and new Border Protection for good of country... Bipartisan Bill! 

California has a rare opportunity to turn things around and solve its high crime, high tax, problems - along with so many others.  On June 5th. , vote for GOP Gubernatorial Candidate JOHN COX, a really good and highly competent man.  He’ll Make California Great Again! 

A Democratic lawmaker just introduced a bill to Repeal the GOP Tax Cuts (no chance).  This is too good to be true for Republicans... Remember, the Nancy Pelosi Dems are also weak on Crime, the Border and want to be gentle and kind to MS-13 gang members... not good! 

Our fallen heroes have not only written our history they have shaped our destiny.  They saved the lives of the men and women with whom they served.  They cared for their families more than anything in the world, they loved their families.  They inspired their communities.... 

The heroes who rest in these hallowed fields, in cemeteries, battlefields, and burial grounds near and far are drawn the full tapestry of American life.  They came from every generation from towering cities and wind swept prairies, from privilege and from poverty.... 

Thank you for joining us on this solemn day of remembrance.  We are gathered here on the sacred soil of @ArlingtonNatl Cemetery to honor the lives and deeds of America's greatest heroes, the men and women who laid down their lives for our freedom.  #MemorialDay. 

“We now find out that the Obama Administration put the opposing campaigns presidential candidate, or his campaign, under investigation.  That raises legitimate questions.  I just find this really odd... this goes to the heart of our electoral system. ” Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews\. 

“Sally Yates is part of concerns people have raised about bias in the Justice Dept.  I find her actions to be really quite unbelievable. ” Jonathan Turley\. 

“The President deserves some answers. ” @FoxNews in discussing “SPYGATE. ”

Happy Memorial Day!  Those who died for our great country would be very happy and proud at how well our country is doing today.  Best economy in decades, lowest unemployment numbers for Blacks and Hispanics EVER (& women in 18years), rebuilding our Military and so much more.  Nice! 

#MemorialDay<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

Why didn’t President Obama do something about the so-called Russian Meddling when he was told about it by the FBI before the Election?  Because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win, and he didn’t want to upset the apple cart!  He was in charge, not me, and did nothing. 

Our United States team has arrived in North Korea to make arrangements for the Summit between Kim Jong Un and myself.  I truly believe North Korea has brilliant potential and will be a great economic and financial Nation one day.  Kim Jong Un agrees with me on this.  It will happen! 

Why didn’t the 13 Angry Democrats investigate the campaign of Crooked Hillary Clinton, many crimes, much Collusion with Russia?  Why didn’t the FBI take the Server from the DNC?   Rigged Investigation! 

Fantastic to have 400,000 GREAT MEN & WOMEN of Rolling Thunder in D. C.  showing their patriotism.  They love our Country, they love our Flag, they stand for our National Anthem!  Thanks to Executive Director Artie Muller. 

Who’s going to give back the young and beautiful lives (and others) that have been devastated and destroyed by the phony Russia Collusion Witch Hunt?  They journeyed down to Washington, D. C. , with stars in their eyes and wanting to help our nation... They went back home in tatters! 

WELCOME HOME JOSH!. 

When will the 13 Angry Democrats (& those who worked for President O), reveal their disqualifying Conflicts of Interest?  It’s been a long time now!  Will they be indelibly written into the Report along with the fact that the only Collusion is with the Dems, Justice, FBI & Russia? 

This whole Russia Probe is Rigged.  Just an excuse as to why the Dems and Crooked Hillary lost the Election and States that haven’t been lost in decades.  13 Angry Democrats, and all Dems if you include the people who worked for Obama for 8 years.  #SPYGATE & CONFLICTS OF INTEREST! 

With Spies, or “Informants” as the Democrats like to call them because it sounds less sinister (but it’s not), all over my campaign, even from a very early date, why didn’t the crooked highest levels of the FBI or “Justice” contact me to tell me of the  phony Russia problem? 

The Failing @nytimes quotes “a senior White House official,” who doesn’t exist, as saying “even if the meeting were reinstated, holding it on June 12 would be impossible, given the lack of time and the amount of planning needed. ” WRONG AGAIN!  Use real people, not phony sources. 

Unlike what the Failing and Corrupt New York Times would like people to believe, there is ZERO disagreement within the Trump Administration as to  how to deal with North Korea... and if there was, it wouldn’t matter.  The @nytimes has called me wrong right from the beginning! 

Thanks to very brave Teacher & Hero Jason Seaman of Noblesville, Indiana, for his heroic act in saving so many precious young lives.  His quick and automatic action is being talked about all over the world! 

Looking forward to seeing Joshua Holt this evening in the White House.  The great people of Utah are Celebrating! 

Put pressure on the Democrats to end the horrible law that separates children from there parents once they cross the Border into the U. S.  Catch and Release, Lottery and Chain must also go with it and we MUST continue building the WALL!  DEMOCRATS ARE PROTECTING MS-13 THUGS. 

Good news about the release of the American hostage from Venezuela.  Should be landing in D. C.  this evening and be in the White House, with his family, at about 7:00 P. M.  The great people of Utah will be very happy! 

We are having very productive talks with North Korea about reinstating the Summit which, if it does happen, will likely remain in Singapore on the same date, June 12th. , and, if necessary, will be extended beyond that date. 

... but complain and obstruct.  They made only bad deals (Iran) and their so-called Trade Deals are the laughing stock of the world! 

Senator Schumer and Obama Administration let phone company ZTE flourish with no security checks.  I closed it down then let it reopen with high level security guarantees, change of management and board, must purchase U. S.  parts and pay a $1. 3 Billion fine.  Dems do nothing.... 

Funny to watch the Democrats criticize Trade Deals being negotiated by me when they don’t even know what the deals are and when for 8 years the Obama Administration did NOTHING on trade except let other countries rip off the United States.  Lost almost $800 Billion/year under “O”

Chicago Police have every right to legally protest against the mayor and an administration that just won’t let them do their job.  The killings are at a record pace and tough police work, which Chicago will not allow, would bring things back to order fast... the killings must stop! 

To the @NavalAcademy Class of 2018, I say: We know you are up to the task.  We know you will make us proud.  We know that glory will be yours.  Because you are WINNERS, you are WARRIORS, you are FIGHTERS, you are CHAMPIONS, and YOU will lead us to VICTORY!  God Bless the U. S. A.!. 

On behalf of the American People, CONGRATULATIONS!  We love you!. 

Today, it was my great honor to deliver the 2018 Commencement Address at the United States @NavalAcademy in Annapolis, Maryland.  Congratulations! Good luck.  Godspeed.  And ANCHORS AWEIGH!. 

Very good news to receive the warm and productive statement from North Korea.  We will soon see where it will lead, hopefully to long and enduring prosperity and peace.  Only time (and talent) will tell! 

Democrats are so obviously rooting against us in our negotiations with North Korea.  Just like they are coming to the defense of MS 13 thugs, saying that they are individuals & must be nurtured, or asking to end your big Tax Cuts & raise your taxes instead.  Dems have lost touch! 

“Everyone knows there was a Spy, and in fact the people who were involved in the Spying are admitting that there was a Spy... Widespread Spying involving multiple people. ” Mollie Hemingway, The Federalist Senior Editor  But the corrupt Mainstream Media hates this monster story! 

Can anyone even imagine having Spies placed in a competing campaign, by the people and party in absolute power, for the sole purpose of political advantage and gain?  And to think that the party in question, even with the expenditure of far more money, LOST! 

The Democrats are now alluding to the the concept that having an Informant placed in an opposing party’s campaign is different than having a Spy, as illegal as that may be.  But what about an “Informant” who is paid a fortune and who “sets up” way earlier than the Russian Hoax? 

Today, it was my great honor to present the #MedalOfHonor to @USNavy (SEAL) Master Chief Special Warfare Operator Britt Slabinski in the East Room of the @WhiteHouse.  Full ceremony. 

Today, it was my honor to sign #S2155, the "Economic Growth, Regulatory Relief, and Consumer Protection Act. ” Read more. 

I have decided to terminate the planned Summit in Singapore on June 12th.  While many things can happen and a great opportunity lies ahead potentially, I believe that this is a tremendous setback for North Korea and indeed a setback for the world.... 

It was my great honor to host a roundtable re: MS-13 yesterday in Bethpage, New York.  Democrats must abandon their resistance to border security so that we can SUPPORT law enforcement and SAVE innocent lives!. 

Sadly, I was forced to cancel the Summit Meeting in Singapore with Kim Jong Un.. 

Not surprisingly, the GREAT Men & Women of the FBI are starting to speak out against Comey, McCabe and all of the political corruption and poor leadership found within the top ranks of the FBI.  Comey was a terrible and corrupt leader who inflicted great pain on the FBI!  #SPYGATE\. 

Clapper has now admitted that there was Spying in my campaign.  Large dollars were paid to the Spy, far beyond normal.  Starting to look like one of the biggest political scandals in U. S.  history.  SPYGATE - a terrible thing! 

Will be interviewed on @foxandfriends tomorrow morning at 6:00 A. M.  Enjoy! 

Great to be in New York for the day.  Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now, lots of work to be done!. 

Thank you to all of the incredible law enforcement officers and firefighters in Bethpage, New York.  Keep up the great work!. 

Crippling loopholes in our laws have enabled MS-13 gang members and other criminals to infiltrate our communities - and Democrats in Congress REFUSE to close these loopholes, including the disgraceful practice known as Catch-and-Release.  Democrats must abandon their resistance.... 

Today on Long Island, we were all moved to be joined by families who have suffered unthinkable heartbreak at the hands of MS-13.  I was truly honored to be joined again by the courageous families who were my guests at the State of the Union.... 

Thank you @SBAList!  #SBAGala. 

WITCH HUNT! 

There will be big news coming soon for our great American Autoworkers.  After many decades of losing your jobs to other countries, you have waited long enough! 

Big legislation will be signed by me shortly.  After many years, RIGHT TO TRY and big changes to DODD FRANK. 

Our Trade Deal with China is moving along nicely, but in the end we will probably have to use a different structure in that this will be too hard to get done and to verify results after completion. 

“Trump should be happy that the FBI was SPYING on his campaign” No, James Clapper, I am not happy.  Spying on a campaign would be illegal, and a scandal to boot! 

Everybody is with Tomi Lahren, a truly outstanding and respected young woman!  @foxandfriends\. 

SPYGATE could be one of the biggest political scandals in history! 

“It’s clear that they had eyes and ears all over the Trump Campaign” Judge Andrew Napolitano\. 

Look how things have turned around on the Criminal Deep State.  They go after Phony Collusion with Russia, a made up Scam, and end up getting caught in a major SPY scandal the likes of which this country may never have seen before!  What goes around, comes around! 

@foxandfriends  “New Bombshell in the Obama Spying Scandal.  Did other Agencies SPY on Trump Campaign? ” Even Clapper, worlds dumbest former Intelligence Head, who has the problem of lying a lot, used the word SPY when describing the illegal activities! 

... Follow the money!  The spy was there early in the campaign and yet never reported Collusion with Russia, because there was no Collusion.  He was only there to spy for political reasons and to help Crooked Hillary win - just like they did to Bernie Sanders, who got duped! 

If the person placed very early into my campaign wasn’t a SPY put there by the previous Administration for political purposes, how come such a seemingly massive amount of money was paid for services rendered - many times higher than normal... 

For the first time since Roe v.  Wade, America has a Pro-Life President, a Pro-Life Vice President, a Pro-Life House of Representatives and 25 Pro-Life Republican State Capitals!. 

It was my honor to welcome @NASCAR Cup Series Champion @MartinTruex_Jr and his team to the @WhiteHouse yesterday!. 

Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Moon Jae-in of the Republic of Korea to the @WhiteHouse! <Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of South Korea>. 

. @AsaHutchinson, the great Governor of Arkansas, is in a primary tomorrow.  He has done an incredible job with a focus on lower taxes, border security, and crime prevention.  Asa loves our military and our veterans.  I fully endorse Asa for Governor! 

Under our potential deal with China, they will purchase from our Great American Farmers practically as much as our Farmers can produce. 

The Wall Street Journal asks, “WHERE IN THE WORLD WAS BARACK OBAMA? ”  A very good question! 

... they then used to start an investigation about Trump.  It is that simple.  This guy is the genesis of this whole Debacle.  This was a Political hit job, this was not an Intelligence Investigation.  Brennan has disgraced himself, he’s worried about staying out of Jail. ” Dan Bongino\. 

.... top of the FBI.  Brennan started this entire debacle about President Trump.  We now know that Brennan had detailed knowledge of the (phony) Dossier... he knows about the Dossier, he denies knowledge of the Dossier, he briefs the Gang of 8 on the Hill about the Dossier, which.... 

“John Brennan is panicking.  He has disgraced himself, he has disgraced the Country, he has disgraced the entire Intelligence Community.  He is the one man who is largely responsible for the destruction of American’s faith in the Intelligence Community and in some people at the.... 

China must continue to be strong & tight on the Border of North Korea until a deal is made.  The word is that recently the Border has become much more porous and more has been filtering in.  I want this to happen, and North Korea to be VERY successful, but only after signing! 

On China, Barriers and Tariffs to come down for first time. 

China has agreed to buy massive amounts of ADDITIONAL Farm/Agricultural Products - would be one of the best things to happen to our farmers in many years! 

I ask Senator Chuck Schumer, why didn’t President Obama & the Democrats do something about Trade with China, including Theft of Intellectual Property etc.?  They did NOTHING!  With that being said, Chuck & I have long agreed on this issue!  Fair Trade, plus, with China will happen! 

I hereby demand, and will do so officially tomorrow, that the Department of Justice look into whether or not the FBI/DOJ infiltrated or surveilled the Trump Campaign for Political Purposes - and if any such demands or requests were made by people within the Obama Administration! 

The Witch Hunt finds no Collusion with Russia - so now they’re looking at the rest of the World.  Oh’ great! 

.... and why hasn’t the Podesta brother been charged and arrested, like others, after being forced to close down his very large and successful firm?  Is it because he is a VERY well connected Democrat working in the Swamp of Washington, D. C.? 

What ever happened to the Server, at the center of so much Corruption, that the Democratic National Committee REFUSED to hand over to the hard charging (except in the case of Democrats) FBI?  They broke into homes & offices early in the morning, but were afraid to take the Server? 

Now that the Witch Hunt has given up on Russia and is looking at the rest of the World, they should easily be able to take it into the Mid-Term Elections where they can put some hurt on the Republican Party.  Don’t worry about Dems FISA Abuse, missing Emails or Fraudulent Dossier! 

... in the Hillary Clinton Campaign where she deleted 33,000 Emails, got $145,000,000 while Secretary of State, paid McCabes wife $700,000 (and got off the FBI hook along with Terry M) and so much more.  Republicans and real Americans should start getting tough on this Scam. 

.... At what point does this soon to be $20,000,000 Witch Hunt, composed of 13 Angry and Heavily Conflicted Democrats and two people who have worked for Obama for 8 years, STOP!  They have found no Collussion with Russia, No Obstruction, but they aren’t looking at the corruption... 

Things are really getting ridiculous.  The Failing and Crooked (but not as Crooked as Hillary Clinton) @nytimes has done a long & boring story indicating that the World’s most expensive Witch Hunt has found nothing on Russia & me so now they are looking at the rest of the World! 

If the FBI or DOJ was infiltrating a campaign for the benefit of another campaign, that is a really big deal.  Only the release or review of documents that the House Intelligence Committee (also, Senate Judiciary) is asking for can give the conclusive answers.  Drain the Swamp! 

Great to have our incredible First Lady back home in the White House.  Melania is feeling and doing really well.  Thank you for all of your prayers and best wishes! 

Happy #ArmedForcesDay to our GREAT military men and women for their selfless service to our Nation!. 

America is blessed with extraordinary energy abundance, including more than 250 years worth of beautiful clean coal.  We have ended the war on coal, and will continue to work to promote American energy dominance! 

California finally deserves a great Governor, one who understands borders, crime and lowering taxes.  John Cox is the man - he’ll be the best Governor you’ve ever had.  I fully endorse John Cox for Governor and look forward to working with him to Make California Great Again! 

@nikkihaley Just met with UN Secretary-General António Guterres who is working hard to “Make the United Nations Great Again. ” When the UN does more to solve conflicts around the world, it means the U. S.  has less to do and we save money.  @NikkiHaley is doing a fantastic job!. 

America is a Nation that believes in the power of redemption.  America is a Nation that believes in second chances - and America is a Nation that believes that the best is always yet to come!  #PrisonReform. 

We grieve for the terrible loss of life, and send our support and love to everyone affected by this horrible attack in Texas.  To the students, families, teachers and personnel at Santa Fe High School – we are with you in this tragic hour, and we will be with you forever.... 

School shooting in Texas.  Early reports not looking good.  God bless all! 

Reports are there was indeed at least one FBI representative implanted, for political purposes, into my campaign for president.  It took place very early on, and long before the phony Russia Hoax became a “hot” Fake News story.  If true - all time biggest political scandal! 

Why isn’t disgraced FBI official Andrew McCabe being investigated for the $700,000 Crooked Hillary Democrats in Virginia, led by Clinton best friend Terry M (under FBI investigation that they killed) gave to McCabe’s wife in her run for office?  Then dropped case on Clinton! 

Fake News Media had me calling Immigrants, or Illegal Immigrants, “Animals. ” Wrong!  They were begrudgingly forced to withdraw their stories.  I referred to MS 13 Gang Members as “Animals,” a big difference - and so true.  Fake News got it purposely wrong, as usual! 

“Apparently the DOJ put a Spy in the Trump Campaign.  This has never been done before and by any means necessary, they are out to frame Donald Trump for crimes he didn’t commit. ”  David Asman  @LouDobbs @GreggJarrett   Really bad stuff! 

It was my great honor to visit with our HEROES last night at Walter Reed Medical Center.  There is nobody like them!. 

Tomorrow, the House will vote on a strong Farm Bill, which includes work requirements.  We must support our Nation’s great farmers! 

Great talk with my friend President Mauricio Macri of Argentina this week.  He is doing such a good job for Argentina.  I support his vision for transforming his country’s economy and unleashing its potential! 

Talking trade with the Vice Premier of the People’s Republic of China, Liu He.. 

Congratulations to our new CIA Director, Gina Haspel!. 

Congrats to the House for passing the VA MISSION Act yesterday.  Without this funding our veterans will be forced to stand in never ending lines in order to receive care.  Putting politics over our veterans care is UNACCEPTABLE – Senate must vote yes on this bill by Memorial Day! 

Despite the disgusting, illegal and unwarranted Witch Hunt, we have had the most successful first 17 month Administration in U. S.  history - by far!  Sorry to the Fake News Media and “Haters,” but that’s the way it is! 

Wow, word seems to be coming out that the Obama FBI “SPIED ON THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN WITH AN EMBEDDED INFORMANT. ” Andrew McCarthy says, “There’s probably no doubt that they had at least one confidential informant in the campaign. ” If so, this is bigger than Watergate! 

Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History... and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction.  The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money! 

Gina Haspel is one step closer to leading our brave men and women at the CIA.  She is exceptionally qualified and the Senate should confirm her immediately.  We need her to keep our great country safe!  #ConfirmGina\. 

... and voted against the massive Tax Cut Bill.  He’s also weak on borders and crime.  Sadly, our great Military and Vets mean nothing to Bobby Jr.  Lou Barletta will win!  #MAGA\. 

Lou Barletta will be a great Senator for Pennsylvania but his opponent, Bob Casey, has been a do-nothing Senator who only shows up at election time.  He votes along the Nancy Pelosi, Elizabeth Warren lines, loves sanctuary cities, bad and expensive healthcare... 

Today, it was my great honor to welcome President Mirziyoyev of Uzbekistan to the @WhiteHouse!. 

House votes today on Choice/MISSION Act.  Who will stand with our Great Vets, caregivers, and Veterans Service Organizations?  Must get Choice passed by Memorial Day! 

... haven’t even started yet!  The U. S.  has very little to give, because it has given so much over the years.  China has much to give! 

... We have not seen China’s demands yet, which should be few in that previous U. S.  Administrations have done so poorly in negotiating.  China has seen our demands.  There has been no folding as the media would love people to believe, the meetings... 

The Washington Post and CNN have typically written false stories about our trade negotiations with China.  Nothing has happened with ZTE except as it pertains to the larger trade deal.  Our country has been losing hundreds of billions of dollars a year with China... 

Congratulations to Deb Fischer.  The people of Nebraska have seen what a great job she is doing - and it showed up at the ballot box!  #MAGA\. 

Congratulations to Lou Barletta of Pennsylvania.  He will be a great Senator and will represent his people well - like they haven’t been represented in many years.  Lou is a friend of mine and a special guy, he will very much help MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Thank you to the Washington Examiner and @CortesSteve on the great article - on WINNING!. 

#PeaceOfficersMemorialDay. 

Today is one of the most important and solemn occasions of the year – the day we pay tribute to the Law Enforcement Heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty.  They made the ultimate sacrifice so that we could live in safety and peace.  We stand with our police (HEROES) 100%!. 

Nebraska - make sure you get out to the polls and VOTE for Deb Fischer today!. 

Can you believe that with all of the made up, unsourced stories I get from the Fake News Media, together with the  $10,000,000 Russian Witch Hunt (there is no Collusion), I now have my best Poll Numbers in a year.  Much of the Media may be corrupt, but the People truly get it! 

Trade negotiations are continuing with China.  They have been making hundreds of billions of dollars a year from the U. S. , for many years.  Stay tuned! 

Our great First Lady is doing really well.  Will be leaving hospital in 2 or 3 days.  Thank you for so much love and support! 

Heading over to Walter Reed Medical Center to see our great First Lady, Melania.  Successful procedure, she is in good spirits.  Thank you to all of the well-wishers! 

The so-called leaks coming out of the White House are a massive over  exaggeration put out by the Fake News Media in order to make us look as bad as possible.  With that being said, leakers are traitors and cowards, and we will find out who they are! 

ZTE, the large Chinese phone company, buys a big percentage of individual parts from U. S.  companies.  This is also reflective of the larger trade deal we are negotiating with China and my personal relationship with President Xi. 

#USEmbassyJerusalem. 

Big day for Israel.  Congratulations! 

U. S.  Embassy opening in Jerusalem will be covered live on @FoxNews & @FoxBusiness.  Lead up to 9:00 A. M.  (eastern) event has already begun.  A great day for Israel! 

So sad to see the Terror Attack in Paris.  At some point countries will have to open their eyes & see what is really going on.  This kind of sickness & hatred is not compatible with a loving, peaceful, & successful country!  Changes to our thought process on terror must be made. 

Remember how badly Iran was behaving with the Iran Deal in place.  They were trying to take over the Middle East by whatever means necessary.  Now, that will not happen! 

China and the United States are working well together on trade, but past negotiations have been so one sided in favor of China, for so many years, that it is hard for them to make a deal that benefits both countries.  But be cool, it will all work out! 

President Xi of China, and I, are working together to give massive Chinese phone company, ZTE, a way to get back into business, fast.  Too many jobs in China lost.  Commerce Department has been instructed to get it done! 

Happy Mother’s Day!!!. 

The Senate should get funding done before the August break, or NOT GO HOME.  Wall and Border Security should be included.  Also waiting for approval of almost 300 nominations, worst in history.  Democrats are doing everything possible to obstruct, all they know how to do.  STAY! 

Iran’s Military Budget is up more than 40% since the Obama negotiated Nuclear Deal was reached... just another indicator that it was all a big lie.  But not anymore! 

North Korea has announced that they will dismantle Nuclear Test Site this month, ahead of the big Summit Meeting on June 12th.  Thank you, a very smart and gracious gesture! 

Why doesn’t the Fake News Media state that the Trump Administration’s Anti-Trust Division has been, and is, opposed to the AT&T purchase of Time Warner in a currently ongoing Trial.  Such a disgrace in reporting! 

Big week next week when the American Embassy in Israel will be moved to Jerusalem.  Congratulations to all! 

The American people deserve a healthcare system that takes care of them – not one that takes advantage of them.  We will work every day to ensure all Americans have access to the quality, affordable medication they need and deserve.  We will not rest until the job is done!. 

Today, my Administration is launching the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American People.  We will have tougher negotiation, more competition, and much lower prices at the pharmacy counter!. 

Thank you Indiana!  #MAGA<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

The highly anticipated meeting between Kim Jong Un and myself will take place in Singapore on June 12th.  We will both try to make it a very special moment for World Peace! 

Five Most Wanted leaders of ISIS just captured! 

Senator Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fought hard against the Bad Iran Deal, even going at it with President Obama, & then Voted AGAINST it!  Now he says I should not have terminated the deal - but he doesn’t really believe that!  Same with Comey.  Thought he was terrible until I fired him! 

On behalf of the American people, WELCOME HOME!. 

Gina Haspel did a spectacular job today.  There is nobody even close to run the CIA! 

Looking forward to greeting the Hostages (no longer) at 2:00 A. M. 

The Failing New York Times criticized Secretary of State Pompeo for being AWOL (missing), when in fact he was flying to North Korea.  Fake News, so bad! 

Secretary Pompeo and his “guests” will be landing at Andrews Air Force Base at 2:00 A. M.  in the morning.  I will be there to greet them.  Very exciting! 

I am pleased to inform you that Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is in the air and on his way back from North Korea with the 3 wonderful gentlemen that everyone is looking so forward to meeting.  They seem to be in good health.  Also, good meeting with Kim Jong Un.  Date & Place set. 

Congratulations to Mike Dewine on his big win in the Great State of Ohio.  He will be a great Governor with a heavy focus on HealthCare and Jobs.   His Socialist opponent in November should not do well, a big failure in last job! 

Candace Owens of Turning Point USA is having a big impact on politics in our Country.  She represents an ever expanding group of very smart “thinkers,” and it is wonderful to watch and hear the dialogue going on... so good for our Country! 

The Fake News is working overtime.  Just reported that, despite the tremendous success we are having with the economy & all things else, 91% of the Network News about me is negative (Fake).  Why do we work so hard in working with the media when it is corrupt?  Take away credentials? 

The Republican Party had a great night.  Tremendous voter energy and excitement, and all candidates are those who have a great chance of winning in November.  The Economy is sooo strong, and with Nancy Pelosi wanting to end the big Tax Cuts and Raise Taxes, why wouldn’t we win? 

The Iran Deal is defective at its core.  If we do nothing, we know what will happen.  In just a short time, the world’s leading state sponsor of terror will be on the cusp of acquiring the world’s most dangerous weapons..... 

Statement on the Iran Nuclear Deal. 

John Kerry can’t get over the fact that he had his chance and blew it!  Stay away from negotiations John, you are hurting your country! 

I will be speaking to my friend, President Xi of China, this morning at 8:30.  The primary topics will be Trade, where good things will happen, and North Korea, where relationships and trust are building. 

Gina Haspel, my highly respected nominee to lead the CIA, is being praised for the fact that she has been, and alway will be, TOUGH ON TERROR!  This is a woman who has been a leader wherever she has gone.  The CIA wants her to lead them into America’s  bright and glorious future! 

I will be announcing my decision on the Iran Deal tomorrow from the White House at 2:00pm. 

National Prescription Drug #TakeBackDay numbers are in!  Another record broken: nearly 1 MILLION pounds of Rx pills disposed!  Let’s keep fighting this opioid epidemic, America! 

The United States does not need John Kerry’s possibly illegal Shadow Diplomacy on the very badly negotiated Iran Deal.   He was the one that created this MESS in the first place! 

Is this Phony Witch Hunt going to go on even longer so it wrongfully impacts the Mid-Term Elections, which is what the Democrats always intended?  Republicans better get tough and smart before it is too late! 

Lisa Page, who may hold the record for the most Emails in the shortest period of time (to her Lover, Peter S), and attorney Baker, are out at the FBI as part of the Probers getting caught?  Why is Peter S still there?  What a total mess.  Our Country has to get back to Business! 

Good luck to Ric Grenell, our new Ambassador to Germany.  A great and talented guy, he will represent our Country well! 

“The Great Revolt” by Salena Zito and Brad Todd does much to tell the story of our great Election victory.  The Forgotten Men & Women are forgotten no longer! 

The 13 Angry Democrats in charge of the Russian Witch Hunt are starting to find out that there is a Court System in place that actually protects people from injustice... and just wait ‘till the Courts get to see your unrevealed Conflicts of Interest! 

The Russia Witch Hunt is rapidly losing credibility.  House Intelligence Committee found No Collusion, Coordination or anything else with Russia.  So now the Probe says OK, what else is there?  How about Obstruction for a made up, phony crime. There is no O, it’s called Fighting Back\. 

My highly respected nominee for CIA Director, Gina Haspel, has come under fire because she was too tough on Terrorists.  Think of that, in these very dangerous times, we have the most qualified person, a woman, who Democrats want OUT because she is too tough on terror.  Win Gina! 

To the great people of West Virginia we have, together, a really great chance to keep making a big difference.  Problem is, Don Blankenship, currently running for Senate, can’t win the General Election in your State... No way!  Remember Alabama.  Vote Rep.  Jenkins or A. G.  Morrisey! 

Thank you Cleveland, Ohio!. 

Our high level delegation is on the way back from China where they had long meetings with Chinese leaders and business representatives.  We will be meeting tomorrow to determine the results, but it is hard for China in that they have become very spoiled with U. S.  trade wins! 

Just returned home to the beautiful White House, from Dallas, where the Arena was packed to the rafters with the great fans and supporters of the @NRA.  It was so wonderful to be there! 

Great book just out by very successful businessman @AndyPuzder.  Always known as somebody who knows how to win, “Capitalist Comeback” will be a big hit! 

I want to thank all of our friends and patriots at the @NRA.  We will never fail, and we will always protect your Second Amendment!  God Bless you, and God Bless America!. 

We are going to demand Congress secure the border in the upcoming CR.  Illegal immigration must end! 

Democrats and liberals in Congress want to disarm law-abiding Americans at the same time they are releasing dangerous criminal aliens and savage gang members onto our streets.  Politicians who put criminal aliens before American Citizens should be voted out of office! 

All of us here today are united by the same timeless values.  We believe that our liberty is a gift from our creator, and that no Government can ever take it away.  We believe in the rule of law - and we support the men and women of law enforcement.  We have pride in our history.... 

JUST OUT: 3. 9% Unemployment.  4% is Broken!  In the meantime, WITCH HUNT! 

Going to Dallas (the GREAT State of Texas) today.  Leaving soon! 

NBC NEWS is wrong again!  They cite “sources” which are constantly wrong.  Problem is, like so many others, the sources probably don’t exist, they are fabricated, fiction!  NBC, my former home with the Apprentice, is now as bad as Fake News CNN.  Sad! 

Andy McCarthy will be on  @LouDobbs tonight.  7:00 P. M.  , @FoxBusiness. 

Because Jobs in the U. S.  are doing so well, Americans receiving unemployment aid is the lowest since 1973.  Great! 

Our Southern Border is under siege.  Congress must act now to change our weak and ineffective immigration laws.  Must build a Wall.  Mexico, which has a massive crime problem, is doing little to help! 

#NationalDayOfPrayer. 

This spring marks 4yrs since the Phoenix VA crisis.  We won't forget what happened to our GREAT VETS.  Choice is vital, but the program needs work & is running out of $.  Congress must fix Choice Program by Memorial Day so VETS can get the care they deserve.  I will sign immediately! 

Today, it was my great honor to celebrate the #NationalDayOfPrayer at the @WhiteHouse, in the Rose Garden!  Proclamation. 

... despite already having signed a detailed letter admitting that there was no affair.  Prior to its violation by Ms.  Clifford and her attorney, this was a private agreement.  Money from the campaign, or campaign contributions, played no roll in this transaction. 

... very common among celebrities and people of wealth.  In this case it is in full force and effect and will be used in Arbitration for damages against Ms.  Clifford (Daniels).  The agreement was used to stop the false and extortionist accusations made by her about an affair,...... 

Mr.  Cohen, an attorney, received a monthly retainer, not from the campaign and having nothing to do with the campaign, from which he entered into, through reimbursement, a private contract between two parties, known as a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA.  These agreements are..... 

Our great financial team is in China trying to negotiate a level playing field on trade!  I look forward to being with President Xi in the not too distant future.  We will always have a good (great) relationship! 

Ainsley Earnhardt, a truly great person, just wrote a wonderful book, “The Light Within Me,” which is doing really well.  She is very special and so is her new book... bring it to number one! 

As everybody is aware, the past Administration has long been asking for three hostages to be released from a North Korean Labor camp, but to no avail.  Stay tuned! 

“This isn’t some game.  You are screwing with the work of the president of the United States. ”  John Dowd, March 2018.   With North Korea, China, the Middle East and so much more, there is not much time to be thinking about this, especially since there was no Russian “Collusion. ”

I have been briefed on the U. S.  C-130 “Hercules” cargo plane from the Puerto Rico National Guard that crashed near Savannah Hilton Head International Airport.  Please join me in thoughts and prayers for the victims, their families and the great men and women of the National Guard. 

Congratulations @SecPompeo!. 

A Rigged System - They don’t want to turn over Documents to Congress.  What are they afraid of?  Why so much redacting?  Why such unequal “justice? ” At some point I will have no choice but to use the powers granted to the Presidency and get involved! 

NEW BOOK - A MUST READ!  “The Russia Hoax - The Illicit Scheme to Clear Hillary Clinton and Frame Donald Trump” by the brilliant Fox News Legal Analyst Gregg Jarrett.  A sad chapter for law enforcement.  A rigged system! 

“The questions are an intrusion into the President’s Article 2  powers under the Constitution to fire any Executive Branch Employee... what the President was thinking is an outrageous..... as to the President’s unfettered power to fire anyone... ” Joe Digenova, former US Attorney\. 

There was no Collusion (it is a Hoax) and there is no Obstruction of Justice (that is a setup & trap).  What there is is Negotiations going on with North Korea over Nuclear War, Negotiations going on with China over Trade Deficits, Negotiations on NAFTA, and much more.  Witch Hunt! 

Today, it was my great honor to thank and welcome heroic crew members and passengers of Southwest Airlines Flight 1380 at the @WhiteHouse!. 

Congratulations @ArmyWP_Football!. 

Today I had the great honor of awarding the Commander-in-Chief’s Trophy, for the first time in 21 years, to the @ArmyWP_Football Black Knights at the @WhiteHouse.  Congratulations!. 

Yesterday, it was my great honor to welcome President @MBuhari of the Federal Republic of Nigeria to the @WhiteHouse! <Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of Nigeria>. 

It would seem very hard to obstruct justice for a crime that never happened!  Witch Hunt! 

Delegation heading to China to begin talks on the Massive Trade Deficit that has been created with our Country.  Very much like North Korea, this should have been fixed years ago, not now.  Same with other countries and NAFTA... but it will all get done.  Great Potential for USA! 

So disgraceful that the questions concerning the Russian Witch Hunt were “leaked” to the media.  No questions on Collusion.  Oh, I see... you have a made up, phony crime, Collusion, that never existed, and an investigation begun with illegally leaked classified information.  Nice! 

The White House is running very smoothly despite phony Witch Hunts etc.  There is great Energy and unending Stamina, both necessary to get things done.  We are accomplishing the unthinkable and setting positive records while doing so!  Fake News is going “bonkers! ”

The Fake News is going crazy making up false stories and using only unnamed sources (who don’t exist).  They are totally unhinged, and the great success of this Administration is making them do and say things that even they can’t believe they are saying.  Truly bad people! 

During Small Business Week, we celebrate the great, hard-working entrepreneurs across our country who have started and operate a small business! 

The migrant ‘caravan’ that is openly defying our border shows how weak & ineffective U. S.  immigration laws are.  Yet Democrats like Jon Tester continue to support the open borders agenda – Tester even voted to protect Sanctuary Cities.  We need lawmakers who will put America First. 

I recently had a terrific meeting with a bipartisan group of freshman lawmakers who feel very strongly in favor of Congressional term limits.  I gave them my full support and endorsement for their efforts.  #DrainTheSwamp\. 

Numerous countries are being considered for the MEETING, but would Peace House/Freedom House, on the Border of North & South Korea, be a more Representative, Important and Lasting site than a third party country?  Just asking! 

The White House Correspondents’ Dinner is DEAD as we know it.  This was a total disaster and an embarrassment to our great Country and all that it stands for.  FAKE NEWS is alive and well and beautifully represented on Saturday night! 

Headline: “Kim Prepared to Cede Nuclear Weapons if U. S.  Pledges Not to Invade” - from the Failing New York Times.  Also, will shut down Nuclear Test Site in May. 

The White House Correspondents’ Dinner was a failure last year, but this year was an embarrassment to everyone associated with it.  The filthy “comedian” totally bombed (couldn’t even deliver her lines-much like the Seth Meyers weak performance).  Put Dinner to rest, or start over! 

“Trump’s Triumphs are driving his critics Crazy! ” Thank you Steve Hilton @NextRevFNC, just want to do what is right for our wonderful U. S. A. 

Just got recent Poll - much higher than President O at same time.... Well, much more has been accomplished! 

While Washington, Michigan, was a big success, Washington, D. C. , just didn’t work.  Everyone is talking about the fact that the White House Correspondents Dinner was a very big, boring bust... the so-called comedian really “bombed. ” @greggutfeld should host next year!  @PeteHegseth\. 

Great evening last night in Washington, Michigan.  The enthusiasm, knowledge and love in that room was unreal.  To the many thousands of people who couldn’t get in, I cherish you.... and will be back! 

Join me LIVE in Washington, Michigan at 7:00pmE on @FoxNews!  #MAGA\. 

Secret Service has just informed me that Senator Jon Tester’s statements on Admiral Jackson are not true.  There were no such findings.  A horrible thing that we in D. C.  must live with, just like phony Russian Collusion.  Tester should lose race in Montana.  Very dishonest and sick! 

Look forward to being in the Great State of Michigan tonight.  Major business expansion and jobs pouring into your State.  Auto companies expanding at record pace.  Big crowd tonight, will be live on T. V. 

Just had a long and very good talk with President Moon of South Korea.  Things are going very well, time and location of meeting with North Korea is being set.  Also spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan to inform him of the ongoing negotiations. 

“Clapper lied about (fraudulent) Dossier leaks to CNN” @foxandfriends FoxNews  He is a lying machine who now works for Fake News CNN. 

.... great people of Montana will not stand for this kind of slander when talking of a great human being.  Admiral Jackson is the kind of man that those in Montana would most respect and admire, and now, for no reason whatsoever, his reputation has been shattered.  Not fair, Tester! 

Allegations made by Senator Jon Tester against Admiral/Doctor Ron Jackson are proving false.  The Secret Service is unable to confirm (in fact they deny) any of the phony Democrat charges which have absolutely devastated the wonderful Jackson family.  Tester should resign.  The..... 

House Intelligence Committee rules that there was NO COLLUSION between the Trump Campaign and Russia.  As I have been saying all along, it is all a big Hoax by the Democrats based on payments and lies.  There should never have been a Special Counsel appointed.  Witch Hunt! 

I urge all Americans to participate in #takebackday tomorrow!  Let’s come together and BEAT last October’s record of disposed prescription pills!  Visit   to learn more on how to participate Saturday and every day.. 

Just Out: House Intelligence Committee Report released.  “No evidence” that the Trump Campaign “colluded, coordinated or conspired with Russia. ” Clinton Campaign paid for Opposition Research obtained from Russia- Wow!  A total Witch Hunt!  MUST END NOW! 

Look forward to meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany today.  So much to discuss, so little time!  It will be good for both of our great countries! 

Kanye West has performed a great service to the Black Community - Big things are happening and eyes are being opened for the first time in Decades - Legacy Stuff!  Thank you also to Chance and Dr.  Darrell Scott, they really get it (lowest Black & Hispanic unemployment in history). 

Please do not forget the great help that my good friend, President Xi of China, has given to the United States, particularly at the Border of North Korea.  Without him it would have been a much longer, tougher, process! 

So great to have Staff Sgt.  Dan Nevins and the incredible WOUNDED WARRIORS with me in the White House yesterday.  These are truly brave and special people!  @foxandfriends\. 

KOREAN WAR TO END!  The United States, and all of its GREAT people, should be very proud of what is now taking place in Korea! 

After a furious year of missile launches and Nuclear testing, a historic meeting between North and South Korea is now taking place.  Good things are happening, but only time will tell! 

Is everybody believing what is going on.  James Comey can’t define what a leak is.  He illegally leaked CLASSIFIED INFORMATION but doesn’t understand what he did or how serious it is.  He lied all over the place to cover it up.  He’s either very sick or very dumb.  Remember sailor! 

The U. S.  has put together a STRONG bid w/ Canada & Mexico for the 2026 World Cup.  It would be a shame if countries that we always support were to lobby against the U. S.  bid.  Why should we be supporting these countries when they don’t support us (including at the United Nations)? 

Loved being on @foxandfriends this morning.  Great show! 

MAGA!. 

Thank you Kanye, very cool!. 

Looking forward to my meeting with Tim Cook of Apple.  We will be talking about many things, including how the U. S.  has been treated unfairly for many years, by many countries, on trade. 

. @FLOTUS did a spectacular job hosting the President of France @EmmanuelMacron and his wife Brigitte.  Every detail was done to perfection.  The State Dining Room never looked more beautiful, and Washington is abuzz over what an incredible job Melania did. 

Busy day planned.   Looking forward to watching President Macron of France address a Joint Session of Congress today.  This is a great honor and seldom allowed to be done... he will be GREAT! 

Congratulations to Republican Debbie Lesko on her big win in the Special Election for Arizona House seat.  Debbie will do a Great Job!  Press is so silent. 

Our two great republics are linked together by the timeless bonds of history, culture, and destiny.  We are people who cherish our values, protect our civilization, and recognize the image of God in every human soul.. 

Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome French President @EmmanuelMacron and Mrs.  Brigitte Macron to the @WhiteHouse.  We look forward to hosting them at tonight's State Dinner, in their honor.. 

. @JimRenacci has worked so hard on Tax Reductions, Illegal Immigration, the Border and Crime.  I need Jim very badly to help our agenda and to keep MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  He will be a fantastic Senator for the Great State of Ohio, and has my full endorsement! 

“President Trump Calls the U. S. -France Relationship ‘Unbreakable. ’ History Shows He’s Right. ”. 

Arizona, please get out today and vote @DebbieLesko for Congress in #AZ08.  Strong on Border, Immigration and Crime.  Great on the Military.  Time is ticking down - get out and VOTE today.  We need Debbie in Congress! 

Americans stand with you and all of Canada, Prime Minister @JustinTrudeau.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you all.  #TorontoStrong. 

Having great meetings and discussions with my friend, President @EmmanuelMacron of France.  We are in the midst of meetings on Iran, Syria and Trade.  We will be holding a joint press conference shortly, here at the @WhiteHouse.  <Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of France>. 

Here’s a great stat - since January 2017, the number of people forced to use food stamps is down 1. 9 million.  The American people are finally back to work! 

Mexico, whose laws on immigration are very tough, must stop people from going through Mexico and into the U. S.  We may make this a condition of the new NAFTA Agreement.  Our Country cannot accept what is happening!  Also, we must get Wall funding fast. 

Despite the Democrat inspired laws on Sanctuary Cities and the Border being so bad and one sided, I have instructed the Secretary of Homeland Security not to let these large Caravans of people into our Country.  It is a disgrace.  We are the only Country in the World so naive!  WALL\. 

Hard to believe Obstructionists May vote against Mike Pompeo for Secretary of State.  The Dems will not approve hundreds of good people, including the Ambassador to Germany.  They are maxing out the time on approval process for all, never happened before.  Need more Republicans! 

Thank you to the incredible Law Enforcement Officers from the Palm Beach County Sheriff’s Office.  They keep us safe and are very cool about it!. 

Kim Strassel of the WSJ just said, after reviewing the dumb Comey Memos, “you got to ask, what was the purpose of the Special Counsel?  There’s no there there. ” Dan Henninger of the WSJ said Memos would show that this would be one of the weakest obstruction cases ever brought! 

Funny how all of the Pundits that couldn’t come close to making a deal on North Korea are now all over the place telling me how to make a deal! 

A complete Witch Hunt! 

“I can die happy now with Trump Job performance,” stated Mary Matalin.  “A great overall President, stunning! ” Thank you Mary. 

.... We are a long way from conclusion on North Korea, maybe things will work out, and maybe they won’t - only time will tell.... But the work I am doing now should have been done a long time ago! 

Sleepy Eyes Chuck Todd of Fake News NBC just stated that we have given up so much in our negotiations with North Korea, and they have given up nothing.  Wow, we haven’t given up anything & they have agreed to denuclearization (so great for World), site closure, & no more testing! 

“GOP Lawmakers asking Sessions to Investigate Comey and Hillary Clinton. ” @FoxNews   Good luck with that request! 

“At least two Memos Comey shared with a friend contained Classified Information. ”  Wall Street Journal\. 

The Washington Post said I refer to Jeff Sessions as “Mr.  Magoo” and Rod Rosenstein as “Mr.  Peepers. ” This is “according to people with whom the president has spoken. ” There are no such people and don’t know these characters... just more Fake & Disgusting News to create ill will! 

James Comey’s Memos are Classified, I did not Declassify them.  They belong to our Government!  Therefore, he broke the law!  Additionally, he totally made up many of the things he said I said, and he is already a proven liar and leaker.  Where are Memos on Clinton, Lynch & others? 

Sylvester Stallone called me with the story of heavyweight boxing champion Jack Johnson.  His trials and tribulations were great, his life complex and controversial.  Others have looked at this over the years, most thought it would be done, but yes, I am considering a Full Pardon! 

So funny, the Democrats have sued the Republicans for Winning.  Now he R’s counter and force them to turn over a treasure trove of material, including Servers and Emails! 

Heading to the Southern White House to watch the Funeral Service of Barbara Bush.  First Lady Melania has arrived in Houston to pay our respects.  Will be a beautiful day! 

Today, my thoughts and prayers are with the entire Bush family.  In memory of First Lady Barbara Bush, there is a remembrance display located at her portrait in the Center Hall of the @WhiteHouse.. 

Fantastic crowd and great people yesterday in Key West, Florida.  Thank you!. 

Join me in Washington, Michigan on Saturday, April 28, 2018 at 7:00pm!  #MAGA Tickets. 

.... it means lying or making up stories.  Sorry, I don’t see Michael doing that despite the horrible Witch Hunt and the dishonest media! 

.... non-existent “sources” and a drunk/drugged up loser who hates Michael, a fine person with a wonderful family.  Michael is a businessman for his own account/lawyer who I have always liked & respected.  Most people will flip if the Government lets them out of trouble, even if.... 

The New York Times and a third rate reporter named Maggie Haberman, known as a Crooked H flunkie who I don’t speak to and have nothing to do with, are going out of their way to destroy Michael Cohen and his relationship with me in the hope that he will “flip. ” They use.... 

A message from Kim Jong Un: “North Korea will stop nuclear tests and launches of intercontinental ballistic missiles. ”Also will “Shut down a nuclear test site in the country’s Northern Side to prove the vow to suspend nuclear tests. ” Progress being made for all! 

James Comey illegally leaked classified documents to the press in order to generate a Special Council?  Therefore, the Special Council was established based on an illegal act?  Really, does everybody know what that means? 

Just heard the Campaign was sued by the Obstructionist Democrats.  This can be good news in that we will now counter for the DNC Server that they refused to give to the FBI, the Debbie Wasserman Schultz Servers and Documents held by the Pakistani mystery man and Clinton Emails. 

North Korea has agreed to suspend all Nuclear Tests and close up a major test site.  This is very good news for North Korea and the World - big progress!  Look forward to our Summit. 

Can you believe that despite 93% bad stories from the Fake News Media (should be getting good stories), today we had just about our highest Poll Numbers, including those on Election Day?  The American public is wise to the phony an dishonest press.  Make America Great Again! 

Looks like OPEC is at it again.  With record amounts of Oil all over the place, including the fully loaded ships at sea, Oil prices are artificially Very High!  No good and will not be accepted! 

Nancy Pelosi is going absolutely crazy about the big Tax Cuts given to the American People by the Republicans... got not one Democrat Vote!  Here’s a choice.  They want to end them and raise your taxes substantially.  Republicans are working on making them permanent and more cuts! 

So exciting!  I have agreed to be the Commencement Speaker at our GREAT Naval Academy on May 25th in Annapolis, Maryland.  Looking forward to being there. 

So General Michael Flynn’s life can be totally destroyed while Shadey James Comey can Leak and Lie and make lots of money from a third rate book (that should never have been written).  Is that really the way life in America is supposed to work?  I don’t think so! 

James Comey Memos just out and show clearly that there was NO COLLUSION and NO OBSTRUCTION.  Also, he leaked classified information.  WOW!  Will the Witch Hunt continue? 

James Comey just threw Andrew McCabe “under the bus. ” Inspector General’s Report on McCabe is a disaster for both of them!  Getting a little (lot) of their own medicine? 

Sanctuary Cities released at least 142 Gang Members across the United States, making it easy for them to commit all forms of violent crimes where none would have existed.  We are doing a great job of law enforcement, but things such as this make safety in America difficult! 

My thoughts, prayers and condolences are with the families, friends and colleagues of the two @GCSOFlorida deputies (HEROES) who lost their lives in the line of duty today. 

Mike Pompeo is outstanding.  First in his class at West Point.  A top student at Harvard Law School.  A success at whatever he has done.  We need the Senate to approve Mike ASAP.  He will be a great Secretary of State! 

... Hopefully the Senate will not leave Washington until our Ambassadors, Judges and the people who make Washington work are approved.  The Democrats are Obstructing the process and we need these people approved for the good of our Country! 

Democrats are obstructing good (hopefully great) people wanting to give up a big portion of their life to work for our Government, hence, the American People.  They are “slow walking” all of my nominations - hundreds of people.  At this rate it would take 9 years for all approvals! 

. @MarshaBlackburn is a wonderful woman who has always been there when we have needed her.  Great on the Military, Border Security and Crime.  Loves and works hard for the people of Tennessee.  She has my full endorsement and I will be there to campaign with her! 

THANK YOU #JIATFSouth, @Norad_Northcom, @southcomwatch and @DHSgov.  Keep up the GREAT work!. 

Just arrived @NASKeyWest!  Heading to a briefing with the Joint Interagency Task Force South, NORTHCOM and SOUTHCOM.. 

Governor Jerry Brown announced he will deploy “up to 400 National Guard Troops” to do nothing.  The crime rate in California is high enough, and the Federal Government will not be paying for Governor Brown’s charade.  We need border security and action, not words! 

Thank you San Diego County for defending the rule of law and supporting our lawsuit against California's illegal and unconstitutional 'Sanctuary' policies.  California's dangerous policies release violent criminals back into our communities, putting all Americans at risk. 

Great meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who has just left Florida.  Talked in depth about North Korea, Military and Trade.  Good things will happen! 

It was my great honor to host my friend @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo and his delegation at Mar-a-Lago for the past two days.  Lots accomplished, thank you!  #Success<Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of Japan>. 

Great working luncheon with U. S.  and Japanese Delegations this afternoon!. 

Prime Minister @AbeShinzo of Japan and myself this morning building an even deeper and better relationship while playing a quick round of golf at Trump International Golf Club.. 

@netanyahu Best wishes to Prime Minister @Netanyahu and all of the people of Israel on the 70th Anniversary of your Great Independence.  We have no better friends anywhere.  Looking forward to moving our Embassy to Jerusalem next month! 

Slippery James Comey, the worst FBI Director in history, was not fired because of the phony Russia investigation where, by the way, there was NO COLLUSION (except by the Dems)! 

Mike Pompeo met with Kim Jong Un in North Korea last week.  Meeting went very smoothly and a good relationship was formed.  Details of Summit are being worked out now.  Denuclearization will be a great thing for World, but also for North Korea! 

A sketch years later about a nonexistent man.  A total con job, playing the Fake News Media for Fools (but they know it)!. 

There is a Revolution going on in California.  Soooo many Sanctuary areas want OUT of this ridiculous, crime infested & breeding concept.  Jerry Brown is trying to back out of the National Guard at the Border, but the people of the State are not happy.  Want Security & Safety NOW! 

While Japan and South Korea would like us to go back into TPP, I don’t like the deal for the United States.  Too many contingencies and no way to get out if it doesn’t work.  Bilateral deals are far more efficient, profitable and better for OUR workers.  Look how bad WTO is to U. S. 

Pastor Andrew Brunson, a fine gentleman and Christian leader in the United States, is on trial and being persecuted in Turkey for no reason.  They call him a Spy, but I am more a Spy than he is.  Hopefully he will be allowed to come home to his beautiful family where he belongs! 

It is my great honor to host @JPN_PMO @AbeShinzo!. 

. @FLOTUS Melania and I join the Nation in celebrating the life of Barbara Bush. 

States and Cities throughout our Country are being cheated and treated so badly by online retailers.  Very unfair to traditional tax paying stores! 

.... Congress – House and Senate must quickly pass a legislative fix to ensure violent criminal aliens can be removed from our society.  Keep America Safe! 

Today’s Court decision means that Congress must close loopholes that block the removal of dangerous criminal aliens, including aggravated felons.  This is a public safety crisis that can only be fixed by.... 

Welcome Prime Minister Abe!. 

Rasmussen just came out at 51% Approval despite the Fake News Media.  They were one of the three most accurate on Election Day.  Just about the most inaccurate were CNN and ABC News/Washington Post, and they haven’t changed (get new pollsters).  Much of the media is a Scam! 

Getting ready to meet Prime Minister Abe of Japan, a truly fine gentleman! 

So many people are seeing the benefits of the Tax Cut Bill.  Everyone is talking, really nice to see! 

Looks like Jerry Brown and California are not looking for safety and security along their very porous Border.  He cannot come to terms for the National Guard to patrol and protect the Border.  The high crime rate will only get higher.  Much wanted Wall in San Diego already started! 

I am in Florida and looking forward to my meeting with Prime Minister Abe of Japan.  Working on Trade and Military Security. 

Employment is up, Taxes are DOWN.  Enjoy! 

Russia and China are playing the Currency Devaluation game as the U. S.  keeps raising interest rates.  Not acceptable! 

Comey drafted the Crooked Hillary exoneration long before he talked to her (lied in Congress to Senator G), then based his decisions on her poll numbers.  Disgruntled, he, McCabe, and the others, committed many crimes! 

Just hit 50% in the Rasmussen Poll, much higher than President Obama at same point.  With all of the phony stories and Fake News, it’s hard to believe!  Thank you America, we are doing Great Things. 

Slippery James Comey, a man who always ends up badly and out of whack (he is not smart! ), will go down as the WORST FBI Director in history, by far! 

Attorney Client privilege is now a thing of the past.  I have many (too many! ) lawyers and they are probably wondering when their offices, and even homes, are going to be raided with everything, including their phones and computers, taken.  All lawyers are deflated and concerned! 

I never asked Comey for Personal Loyalty.  I hardly even knew this guy.  Just another of his many lies.  His “memos” are self serving and FAKE! 

The Syrian raid was so perfectly carried out, with such precision, that the only way the Fake News Media could demean was by my use of the term “Mission Accomplished. ” I knew they would seize on this but felt it is such a great Military term, it should be brought back.  Use often! 

Comey throws AG Lynch “under the bus! ” Why can’t we all find out what happened on the tarmac in the back of the plane with Wild Bill and Lynch?  Was she promised a Supreme Court seat, or AG, in order to lay off Hillary.  No golf and grandkids talk (give us all a break)! 

The big questions in Comey’s badly reviewed book aren’t answered like, how come he gave up Classified Information (jail), why did he lie to Congress (jail), why did the DNC refuse to give Server to the FBI (why didn’t they TAKE it), why the phony memos, McCabe’s $700,000 & more? 

Unbelievably, James Comey states that Polls, where Crooked Hillary was leading, were a factor in the handling (stupidly) of the Clinton Email probe.  In other words, he was making decisions based on the fact that he thought she was going to win, and he wanted a job.  Slimeball! 

So proud of our great Military which will soon be, after the spending of billions of fully approved dollars, the finest that our Country has ever had.  There won’t be anything, or anyone, even close! 

A perfectly executed strike last night.  Thank you to France and the United Kingdom for their wisdom and the power of their fine Military.  Could not have had a better result.  Mission Accomplished! 

. 

DOJ just issued the McCabe report - which is a total disaster.  He LIED!  LIED!  LIED!  McCabe was totally controlled by Comey - McCabe is Comey!!  No collusion, all made up by this den of thieves and lowlifes! 

We are bringing back our factories, we are bringing back our jobs, and we are bringing back those four beautiful words: MADE IN THE USA!. 

.... untruthful slime ball who was, as time has proven, a terrible Director of the FBI.  His handling of the Crooked Hillary Clinton case, and the events surrounding it, will go down as one of the worst “botch jobs” of history.  It was my great honor to fire James Comey! 

James Comey is a proven LEAKER & LIAR.  Virtually everyone in Washington thought he should be fired for the terrible job he did-until he was, in fact, fired.  He leaked CLASSIFIED information, for which he should be prosecuted.  He lied to Congress under OATH.  He is a weak and..... 

Tremendous pressure is building, like never before, for the Border Wall and an end to crime cradling Sanctuary Cities.  Started the Wall in San Diego, where the people were pushing really hard to get it.  They will soon be protected! 

Would only join TPP if the deal were substantially better than the deal offered to Pres.  Obama.  We already have BILATERAL deals with six of the eleven nations in TPP, and are working to make a deal with the biggest of those  nations, Japan, who has hit us hard on trade for years! 

America’s greatest treasure is our people – and my Administration HEARS YOUR VOICE and HAS YOUR BACK.  We are fighting to give every American a future of dignity, purpose and pride.  AMERICAN SPIRIT is back!  #TaxCuts. 

Thank you to all of the American workers who travelled here today!  This event is dedicated to YOU: the hardworking Americans who make this nation run.  You love your country, you provide for your family, you have PRIDE in your work and you cherish our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG!  #TaxCuts. 

I have agreed with the historically cooperative, disciplined approach that we have engaged in with Robert Mueller (Unlike the Clintons! ).  I have full confidence in Ty Cobb, my Special Counsel, and have been fully advised throughout each phase of this process. 

On Yom HaShoah we remember the six million Jews slaughtered in the Holocaust.  With each passing year, our duty to remember this atrocity increases as we pledge #NeverAgain.  #HolocaustRemembranceDay. 

Good luck to Mike Pompeo during his Confirmation Hearing today.  He will be a great Secretary of State! 

Never said when an attack on Syria would take place.  Could be very soon or not so soon at all!  In any event, the United States, under my Administration, has done a great job of ridding the region of ISIS.  Where is our “Thank you America? ”

California Governor Jerry Brown is doing the right thing and sending the National Guard to the Border.  Thank you Jerry, good move for the safety of our Country! 

If I wanted to fire Robert Mueller in December, as reported by the Failing New York Times, I would have fired him.  Just more Fake News from a biased newspaper! 

Big show tonight on @seanhannity!  9:00 P. M.  on @FoxNews\. 

Honored to have Republican Congressional Leadership join me at the @WhiteHouse this evening.  Lots to discuss as we continue MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

“Trump just took a giant step towards actual welfare reform”. 

The @WhiteHouse is partnering with @Interior and @NatlParkService to bring the @NSCsafety's “Prescribed to Death” Opioid Memorial to the Ellipse - beginning tomorrow, April 12th to April 18th.  More information. 

Speaker Paul Ryan is a truly good man, and while he will not be seeking re-election, he will leave a legacy of achievement that nobody can question.  We are with you Paul! 

Much of the bad blood with Russia is caused by the Fake & Corrupt Russia Investigation, headed up by the all Democrat loyalists, or people that worked for Obama.  Mueller is most conflicted of all (except Rosenstein who signed FISA & Comey letter).  No Collusion, so they go crazy! 

Our relationship with Russia is worse now than it has ever been, and that includes the Cold War.  There is no reason for this.  Russia needs us to help with their economy, something that would be very easy to do, and we need all nations to work together.  Stop the arms race? 

Russia vows to shoot down any and all missiles fired at Syria.  Get ready Russia,  because they will be coming, nice and new and “smart! ” You shouldn’t be partners with a Gas Killing Animal who kills his people and enjoys it! 

.... doing things that nobody thought possible, despite the never ending and corrupt Russia Investigation, which takes tremendous time and focus.  No Collusion or Obstruction (other than I fight back), so now they do the Unthinkable, and RAID a lawyers office for information!  BAD! 

So much Fake News about what is going on in the White House.  Very calm and calculated with a big focus on open and fair trade with China, the coming North Korea meeting and, of course, the vicious gas attack in Syria.  Feels great to have Bolton & Larry K on board.  I (we) are\. 

The Failing New York Times wrote another phony story.  It was political pundit Doug Schoen, not a Ukrainian businessman, who asked me to do a short speech by phone (Skype), hosted by Doug, in Ukraine.  I was very positive about Ukraine-another negative to the Fake Russia  C story! 

Today, it was my great honor to welcome the 2017 NCAA Football National Champion, Alabama Crimson Tide - to the White House.  Congratulations!  #RollTide. 

Very thankful for President Xi of China’s kind words on tariffs and automobile barriers... also, his enlightenment on intellectual property and technology transfers.  We will make great progress together! 

Last night, it was my great honor to host America’s senior defense and military leaders for dinner at the White House.  America’s military is the GREATEST fighting force in the history of the world.  They all have my pledge of unwavering commitment to our men and women in uniform!. 

A TOTAL WITCH HUNT!!! 

Attorney–client privilege is dead! 

Great @Cabinet meeting at the @WhiteHouse this morning!. 

The Democrats are not doing what’s right for our country.  I will not rest until we have secured our borders and restored the rule of law!. 

When a car is sent to the United States from China, there is a Tariff to be paid of 2 1/2%.  When a car is sent to China from the United States, there is a Tariff to be paid of 25%.  Does that sound like free or fair trade.   No, it sounds like STUPID TRADE -  going on for years! 

Congratulations to Patrick Reed on his great and courageous MASTERS win!  When Patrick had his amazing win at Doral 5 years ago, people saw his great talent, and a bright future ahead.  Now he is the Masters Champion! 

If President Obama had crossed his stated Red Line In The Sand, the Syrian disaster would have ended long ago!  Animal Assad would have been history! 

.... to pay.  Open area immediately for medical help and verification.  Another humanitarian disaster for no reason whatsoever.  SICK! 

Many dead, including women and children, in mindless CHEMICAL attack in Syria.  Area of atrocity is in lockdown and encircled by Syrian Army, making it completely inaccessible to outside world.  President Putin, Russia and Iran are responsible for backing Animal Assad.  Big price... 

President Xi and I will always be friends, no matter what happens with our dispute on trade.  China will take down its Trade Barriers because it is the right thing to do.  Taxes will become Reciprocal & a deal will be made on Intellectual Property.  Great future for both countries! 

The Washington Post is far more fiction than fact.  Story after story is made up garbage - more like a poorly written novel than good reporting.  Always quoting sources (not names), many of which don’t exist.  Story on John Kelly isn’t true, just another hit job! 

“The FBI closed the case on Hillary, which was a rigged investigation.  They exonerated her even before they ever interviewed her, they never even put her under oath..... ” and much more.  So true Jesse!  @WattersWorld\. 

While Security spending was somewhat more than his predecessor, Scott Pruitt has received death threats because of his bold actions at EPA.  Record clean Air & Water while saving USA Billions of Dollars.  Rent was about market rate, travel expenses OK.  Scott is doing a great job! 

Fire at Trump Tower is out.  Very confined (well built building).  Firemen (and women) did a great job.  THANK YOU! 

What does the Department of Justice and FBI have to hide?  Why aren’t they giving the strongly requested documents (unredacted) to the HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE?  Stalling, but for what reason?  Not looking good! 

Lawmakers of the House Judiciary Committee are angrily accusing the Department of Justice of missing the Thursday Deadline for turning over UNREDACTED Documents relating to FISA abuse, FBI, Comey, Lynch, McCabe, Clinton Emails and much more.  Slow walking - what is going on?  BAD! 

We are sealing up our Southern Border.  The people of our great country want Safety and Security.  The Dems have been a disaster on this very important issue! 

The United States hasn’t had a Trade Surplus with China in 40 years.  They must end unfair trade, take down barriers and charge only Reciprocal Tariffs.  The U. S.  is losing $500 Billion a year, and has been losing Billions of Dollars for decades.  Cannot continue! 

Just spoke to @JustinTrudeau to pay my highest respect and condolences to the families of the terrible Humboldt Team tragedy.  May God be with them all! 

@77WABCradio Congratulations to @bernieandsid on their new @77wabcradio morning radio show in New York City.  It was an honor to join you two – good luck!. 

“BET founder: Trump's economy is bringing black workers back into the labor force”. 

AMERICA IS OPEN FOR BUSINESS!. 

Do you believe that the Fake News Media is pushing hard on a story that I am going to replace A. G.  Jeff Sessions with EPA Chief Scott Pruitt, who is doing a great job but is TOTALLY under siege?  Do people really believe this stuff?  So much of the media is dishonest and corrupt! 

China, which is a great economic power, is considered a Developing Nation within the World Trade Organization.  They therefore get tremendous perks and advantages, especially over the U. S.  Does anybody think this is fair.  We were badly represented.  The WTO is unfair to U. S. 

Despite the Aluminum Tariffs, Aluminum prices are DOWN 4%.  People are surprised, I’m not!  Lots of money coming into U. S.  coffers and Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! 

Thank you @WVGovernor Jim Justice.  It was my great honor to be with the amazing people of West Virginia today!  #MAGA. 

Thanks to our historic TAX CUTS, America is open for business, and millions of American workers are seeing more take-home pay through higher wages, salaries and bonuses!. 

The Fake News Washington Post, Amazon’s “chief lobbyist,” has another (of many) phony headlines, “Trump Defiant As China Adds Trade Penalties. ” WRONG!  Should read, “Trump Defiant as U. S.  Adds Trade Penalties, Will End Barriers And Massive  I. P.  Theft. ” Typically bad reporting! 

The Caravan is largely broken up thanks to the strong immigration laws of Mexico and their willingness to use them so as not to cause a giant scene at our Border.  Because of the Trump Administrations actions, Border crossings are at a still UNACCEPTABLE 46 year low.  Stop drugs! 

“Still Rising: Rasmussen Poll Shows Donald Trump Approval Ratings Now at 51 Percent”. 

Today we honor Dr.  Martin Luther King, Jr.  on the 50th anniversary of his assassination.  Earlier this year I spoke about Dr.  King’s legacy of justice and peace, and his impact on uniting Americans.  #MLK50 Proclamation. 

Our thoughts and prayers are with the four U. S.  Marines from the 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing who lost their lives in yesterday’s Southern California helicopter crash.  We pray for their families, and our great @USMC. 

When you’re already $500 Billion DOWN, you can’t lose! 

We are not in a trade war with China, that war was lost many years ago by the foolish, or incompetent, people who represented the U. S.  Now we have a Trade Deficit of $500 Billion a year, with Intellectual Property Theft of another $300 Billion.  We cannot let this continue! 

Our Border Laws are very weak while those of Mexico & Canada are very strong.  Congress must change these Obama era, and other, laws NOW!  The Democrats stand in our way - they want people to pour into our country unchecked.... CRIME!  We will be taking strong action today. 

Was just briefed on the shooting at YouTube’s HQ in San Bruno, California.  Our thoughts and prayers are with everybody involved.  Thank you to our phenomenal Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders that are currently on the scene. 

WE WILL PROTECT OUR SOUTHERN BORDER!. 

Today, it was my honor to welcome Estonia President @KerstiKaljulaid, Lithuania President @Grybauskaite_LT, and Latvia President @Vejonis to the @WhiteHouse.  Congratulations on your 100th anniversaries of independence!  #BalticSummit. 

I am right about Amazon costing the United States Post Office massive amounts of money for being their Delivery Boy.  Amazon should pay these costs (plus) and not have them bourne by the American Taxpayer.  Many billions of dollars.  P. O.  leaders don’t have a clue (or do they? )! 

Thank you to Rasmussen for the honest polling.  Just hit 50%, which is higher than Cheatin’ Obama at the same time in his Administration. 

Check out the fact that you can’t get a job at ratings challenged @CNN unless you state that you are totally anti-Trump?  Little Jeff Zuker, whose job is in jeopardy, is not having much fun lately.  They should clean up and strengthen CNN and get back to honest reporting! 

The big Caravan of People from Honduras, now coming across Mexico and heading to our “Weak Laws” Border, had better be stopped before it gets there.  Cash cow NAFTA is in play, as is foreign aid to Honduras and the countries that allow this to happen.  Congress MUST ACT NOW! 

The Fake News Networks, those that knowingly have a sick and biased AGENDA, are worried about the competition and quality of Sinclair Broadcast.  The “Fakers” at CNN, NBC, ABC & CBS have done so much dishonest reporting that they should only be allowed to get awards for fiction! 

#AutismAwarenessDay #LightItUpBlue. 

@dcexaminer “President Trump's approval rate among likely U. S.  voters hit 50 percent on Monday, which puts him higher than former President Barack Obama's score at the same point into his first term, according to a new poll. ” Via: @Anna_Giaritelli @DCExaminer. 

39% of my nominations, including Diplomats to foreign lands, have not been confirmed due to Democrat obstruction and delay.  At this rate, it would take more than 7 years before I am allowed to have these great people start working.  Never happened before.  Disgraceful! 

Honduras, Mexico and many other countries that the U. S.  is very generous to, sends many of their people to our country through our WEAK IMMIGRATION POLICIES.  Caravans are heading here.  Must pass tough laws and build the WALL.  Democrats allow open borders, drugs and crime! 

As ridiculous as it sounds, the laws of our country do not easily allow us to send those crossing our Southern Border back where they came from.  A whole big wasted procedure must take place.  Mexico & Canada have tough immigration laws, whereas ours are an Obama joke.  ACT CONGRESS\. 

“President Donald J.  Trump Proclaims April 2, 2018, World Autism Awareness Day”. 

An honor to host the Annual @WhiteHouse Easter Egg Roll!. 

So sad that the Department of “Justice” and the FBI are slow walking, or even not giving, the unredacted documents requested by Congress.  An embarrassment to our country! 

Only fools, or worse, are saying that our money losing Post Office makes money with Amazon.  THEY LOSE A FORTUNE, and this will be changed.  Also, our fully tax paying retailers are closing stores all over the country... not a level playing field! 

So funny to watch Fake News Networks, among the most dishonest groups of people I have ever dealt with, criticize Sinclair Broadcasting for being biased.  Sinclair is far superior to CNN and even more Fake NBC, which is a total joke. 

Mexico is making a fortune on NAFTA... They have very strong border laws - ours are pathetic.  With all of the money they make from the U. S. , hopefully they will stop people from coming through their country and into ours, at least until Congress changes our immigration laws! 

DACA is dead because the Democrats didn’t care or act, and now everyone wants to get onto the DACA bandwagon...  No longer works.  Must build Wall and secure our borders with proper Border legislation.  Democrats want No Borders, hence drugs and crime! 

... Congress must immediately pass Border Legislation, use Nuclear Option if necessary, to stop the massive inflow of Drugs and People.  Border Patrol Agents (and ICE) are GREAT, but the weak Dem laws don’t allow them to do their job.  Act now Congress, our country is being stolen! 

Mexico has the absolute power not to let these large “Caravans” of people enter their country.  They must stop them at their Northern Border, which they can do because their border laws work, not allow them to pass through into our country, which has no effective border laws..... 

These big flows of people are all trying to take advantage of DACA.  They want in on the act! 

Mexico is doing very little, if not NOTHING, at stopping people from flowing into Mexico through their Southern Border, and then into the U. S.  They laugh at our dumb immigration laws.  They must stop the big drug and people flows, or I will stop their cash cow, NAFTA.  NEED WALL! 

Border Patrol Agents are not allowed to properly do their job at the Border because of ridiculous liberal (Democrat) laws like Catch & Release.  Getting more dangerous.  “Caravans” coming.  Republicans must go to Nuclear Option to pass tough laws NOW.  NO MORE DACA DEAL! 

HAPPY EASTER! 

Governor Jerry “Moonbeam” Brown pardoned 5 criminal illegal aliens whose crimes include (1) Kidnapping and Robbery (2) Badly beating wife and threatening a crime with intent to terrorize (3) Dealing drugs.  Is this really what the great people of California want?  @FoxNews\. 

... does not include the Fake Washington Post, which is used as a “lobbyist” and should so  REGISTER.  If the P. O.  “increased its parcel rates, Amazon’s shipping costs would rise by $2. 6 Billion. ” This Post Office scam must stop.  Amazon must pay real costs (and taxes) now! 

While we are on the subject, it is reported that the U. S.  Post Office will lose $1. 50 on average for each package it delivers for Amazon.  That amounts to Billions of Dollars.  The Failing N. Y.  Times reports that “the size of the company’s lobbying staff has ballooned,” and that... 

. 

Washington spent trillions building up foreign countries while allowing OUR OWN infrastructure to fall into a state of total disrepair.  No more!  It's time to REBUILD, and we will do it with American WORKERS, American GRIT, and American PRIDE!. 

JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!  Unemployment claims have fallen to a 45-year low.  Together, we are making the economy great again!. 

We are going to REBUILD our crumbling infrastructure, and there is no better place to begin this campaign than in the Great State of Ohio.  A tremendous honor to be here today at a state-of-the-art training site, where the skills of the American Worker are forged and refined!. 

I have stated my concerns with Amazon long before the Election.  Unlike others, they pay little or no taxes to state & local governments, use our Postal System as their Delivery Boy (causing tremendous loss to the U. S. ), and are putting many thousands of retailers out of business! 

.... In the interim, Hon.  Robert Wilkie of DOD will serve as Acting Secretary.  I am thankful for Dr.  David Shulkin’s service to our country and to our GREAT VETERANS! 

I am pleased to announce that I intend to nominate highly respected Admiral Ronny L.  Jackson, MD, as the new Secretary of Veterans Affairs.... 

Great briefing this afternoon on the start of our Southern Border WALL!. 

.... release known dangerous criminals into communities across the State.  All citizens have the right to be protected by Federal law and strong borders. 

My Administration stands in solidarity with the brave citizens in Orange County defending their rights against California's illegal and unconstitutional Sanctuary policies.  California's Sanctuary laws.... 

. @USTradeRep just announced an agreement in principle with South Korea on KORUS!  A great deal for American and Korean workers.  Let’s now focus on our important security relationship. 

Received message last night from XI JINPING of China that his meeting with KIM JONG UN went very well and that KIM looks forward to his meeting with me.  In the meantime, and unfortunately, maximum sanctions and pressure must be maintained at all cost! 

For years and through many administrations, everyone said that peace and the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula was not even a small possibility.  Now there is a good chance that Kim Jong Un will do what is right for his people and for humanity.  Look forward to our meeting! 

THE SECOND AMENDMENT WILL NEVER BE REPEALED!  As much as Democrats would like to see this happen, and despite the words yesterday of former Supreme Court Justice Stevens, NO WAY.  We need more Republicans in 2018 and must ALWAYS hold the Supreme Court! 

I am very pleased to welcome the opioid memorial to the President's Park in April.  I encourage all to visit and remember those who we have lost to this deadly epidemic.  We will keep fighting until we defeat the opioid crisis!. 

Trade talks going on with numerous countries that, for many years, have not treated the United States fairly.  In the end, all will be happy! 

Great news!  #MAGA. 

So much Fake News.  Never been more voluminous or more inaccurate.  But through it all, our country is doing great! 

The economy is looking really good.  It has been many years that we have seen these kind of numbers.  The underlying strength of companies has perhaps never been better. 

. @HowieCarrShow just wrote a book which everyone is talking about.  He was a great help.  He is a veteran journalist who had a great influence in NH and beyond.  He calls it the most amazing political campaign of modern times.  The book is called, “What Really Happened. ” Enjoy!  #MAGA. 

“President Donald J.  Trump Proclaims March 25, 2018, as Greek Independence Day: A National Day of Celebration of Greek and American Democracy”. 

Happy National #MedalOfHonorDay to our HEROES.  We love you!. 

.... lawyer or law firm will take months to get up to speed (if for no other reason than they can bill more), which is unfair to our great country - and I am very happy with my existing team.  Besides, there was NO COLLUSION with Russia, except by Crooked Hillary and the Dems! 

Many lawyers and top law firms want to represent me in the Russia case... don’t believe the Fake News narrative that it is hard to find a lawyer who wants to take this on.  Fame & fortune will NEVER be turned down by a lawyer, though some are conflicted.  Problem is that a new...... 

Much can be done with the $1. 6 Billion given to building and fixing the border wall.  It is just a down payment.  Work will start immediately.  The rest of the money will come - and remember DACA, the Democrats abandoned you (but we will not)! 

Because of the $700 & $716 Billion Dollars gotten to rebuild our Military, many jobs are created and our Military is again rich.  Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense.  Build WALL through M! 

France honors a great hero.  Officer died after bravely swapping places with hostage in ISIS related terror attack.  So much bravery around the world constantly fighting radical Islamic terrorism.  Even stronger measures needed, especially at borders! 

Our thoughts and prayers are with the victims of the horrible attack in France yesterday, and we grieve the nation’s loss.  We also condemn the violent actions of the attacker and anyone who would provide him support.  We are with you @EmmanuelMacron! 

As a matter of National Security I've signed the Omnibus Spending Bill.  I say to Congress: I will NEVER sign another bill like this again.  To prevent this omnibus situation from ever happening again, I'm calling on Congress to give me a line-item veto for all govt spending bills!. 

Obama Administration legalized bump stocks.  BAD IDEA.  As I promised, today the Department of Justice will issue the rule banning BUMP STOCKS with a mandated comment period.  We will BAN all devices that turn legal weapons into illegal machine guns. 

News conference at the White House concerning the Omnibus Spending Bill.   1:00 P. M. 

I am considering a VETO of the Omnibus Spending Bill based on the fact that the 800,000 plus DACA recipients have been totally abandoned by the Democrats (not even mentioned in Bill) and the BORDER WALL, which is desperately needed for our National Defense, is not fully funded. 

DACA was abandoned by the Democrats.  Very unfair to them!  Would have been tied to desperately needed Wall. 

House Intelligence Committee votes to release final report.  FINDINGS: (1) No evidence provided of Collusion between Trump Campaign & Russia.  (2)  The Obama Administrations Post election response was insufficient.  (3) Clapper provided inconsistent testimony on media contacts. 

I am pleased to announce that, effective 4/9/18, @AmbJohnBolton will be my new National Security Advisor.  I am very thankful for the service of General H. R.  McMaster who has done an outstanding job & will always remain my friend.  There will be an official contact handover on 4/9. 

My honor Charlie - thank you!  #MAGA. 

As a candidate, I pledged that if elected I would use every lawful tool to combat unfair trade, protect American workers, and defend our national security.   Today, we took another critical step to fulfill that commitment.. 

Remember when they were saying, during the campaign, that Donald Trump is giving great speeches and drawing big crowds, but he is spending much less money and not using social media as well as Crooked Hillary’s large and highly sophisticated staff.  Well, not saying that anymore! 

Crazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy.  Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault.  He doesn’t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way.  Don’t threaten people Joe! 

Democrats refused to take care of DACA.  Would have been so easy, but they just didn’t care.  I had to fight for Military and start of Wall. 

Got $1. 6 Billion to start Wall on Southern Border, rest will be forthcoming.  Most importantly, got $700 Billion to rebuild our Military, $716 Billion next year... most ever.  Had to waste money on Dem giveaways in order to take care of military pay increase and new equipment. 

..... They can help solve problems with North Korea, Syria, Ukraine, ISIS, Iran and even the coming Arms Race.  Bush tried to get along, but didn’t have the “smarts. ” Obama and Clinton tried, but didn’t have the energy or chemistry (remember RESET).  PEACE THROUGH STRENGTH! 

I called President Putin of Russia to congratulate him on his election victory (in past, Obama called him also).  The Fake News Media is crazed because they wanted me to excoriate him.  They are wrong!  Getting along with Russia (and others) is a good thing, not a bad thing....... 

“Special Council is told to find crimes, whether a crime exists or not.  I was opposed to the selection of Mueller to be Special Council.  I am still opposed to it.  I think President Trump was right when he said there never should have been a Special Council appointed because..... 

... there was no probable cause for believing that there was any crime, collusion or otherwise, or obstruction of justice! ”  So stated by Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz. 

Department of Justice should have urged the Supreme Court to at least hear the Drivers License case on illegal immigrants in Arizona.  I agree with @LouDobbs.  Should have sought review. 

AUSTIN BOMBING SUSPECT IS DEAD.  Great job by law enforcement and all concerned! 

Our Nation was founded by farmers.  Our independence was won by farmers.  And our continent was tamed by farmers.  Our farmers always lead the way -- we are PROUD of them, and we are DELIVERING for them!  #NationalAgricultureDay\. 

The Democrats do not want to help DACA.  Would be so easy to make a deal! 

A total WITCH HUNT with massive conflicts of interest! 

. @seanhannity on @foxandfriends now!  Great!  8:18 A. M. 

Why does the Mueller team have 13 hardened Democrats, some big Crooked Hillary supporters, and Zero Republicans?  Another Dem recently added... does anyone think this is fair?  And yet, there is NO COLLUSION! 

Spent very little time with Andrew McCabe, but he never took notes when he was with me.  I don’t believe he made memos except to help his own agenda, probably at a later date.  Same with lying James Comey.  Can we call them Fake Memos? 

Wow, watch Comey lie under oath to Senator G when asked “have you ever been an anonymous source... or known someone else to be an anonymous source...? ” He said strongly “never, no. ” He lied as shown clearly on @foxandfriends. 

The Mueller probe should never have been started in that there was no collusion and there was no crime.  It was based on fraudulent activities and a Fake Dossier paid for by Crooked Hillary and the DNC, and improperly used in FISA COURT for surveillance of my campaign.  WITCH HUNT! 

The Fake News is beside themselves that McCabe was caught, called out and fired.  How many hundreds of thousands of dollars was given to wife’s campaign by Crooked H friend, Terry M, who was also under investigation?  How many lies?  How many leaks?  Comey knew it all, and much more! 

As the House Intelligence Committee has concluded, there was no collusion between Russia and the Trump Campaign.  As many are now finding out, however, there was tremendous leaking, lying and corruption at the highest levels of the FBI, Justice & State.  #DrainTheSwamp\. 

Happy #StPatricksDay. 

Andrew McCabe FIRED, a great day for the hard working men and women of the FBI - A great day for Democracy.  Sanctimonious James Comey was his boss and made McCabe look like a choirboy.  He knew all about the lies and corruption going on at the highest levels of the FBI! 

“U. S.  Consumer Confidence Hits 14-Year High”. 

It would be great for the Republican Party of Nevada, and it’s unity if good guy Danny Tarkanian would run for Congress and Dean Heller, who is doing a really good job, could run for Senate unopposed! 

Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and loved ones of the brave troops lost in the helicopter crash on the Iraq-Syria border yesterday.  Their sacrifice in service to our country will never be forgotten. 

“President Donald J.  Trump Delivers Remarks at the Shamrock<Emoji: Shamrock>Bowl Presentation by Prime Minister Varadkar in the East Room of the White House” <Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of Ireland>. 

Continuing to monitor the heartbreaking bridge collapse at FIU - so tragic.  Many brave First Responders rushed in to save lives.  Thank you for your courage.  Praying this evening for all who are affected. 

It was my honor to welcome Prime Minister Leo Varadkar of Ireland to the @WhiteHouse!. 

We do have a Trade Deficit with Canada, as we do with almost all countries (some of them massive).  P. M.  Justin Trudeau of Canada, a very good guy, doesn’t like saying that Canada has a Surplus vs.  the U. S. (negotiating), but they do... they almost all do... and that’s how I know! 

Larry Kudlow will be my Chief Economic Advisor as Director of the National Economic Council.  Our Country will have many years of Great Economic & Financial Success, with low taxes, unparalleled innovation, fair trade and an ever expanding labor force leading the way!  #MAGA\. 

Please join me with your thoughts and prayers for both aviators, their families and our incredible @USNavy.. 

It was wonderful to be back in Missouri where our push for historic TAX CUTS all began.  Six months ago I promised that we would cut taxes to bring Main Street roaring back - and that is exactly what is happening!. 

Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Today the House took major steps toward securing our schools by passing the STOP School Violence Act.  We must put the safety of America's children FIRST by improving training and by giving schools and law enforcement better tools.  A tragedy like Parkland can't happen ever again! 

Thank you for hosting!  #MAGA. 

We cannot keep a blind eye to the rampant unfair trade practices against our Country! 

Five of our incredible @Cabinet Secretaries are testifying on the Hill this morning on the need to rebuild our Nation’s crumbling infrastructure.  We need to build FAST & we need to build for our FUTURE.  Thank you @SenateCommerce for hosting this hearing!  #InfrastructureInAmerica\. 

Perhaps at no time in history have the business fundamentals of U. S.  companies been better than they are today! 

Hundreds of good people, including very important Ambassadors and Judges, are being blocked and/or slow walked by the Democrats in the Senate.  Many important positions in Government are unfilled because of this obstruction.  Worst in U. S.  history! 

All across this nation, we pray for our country and we THANK GOD for our United States Marines!  Thank you.  God Bless You.  And God Bless America!. 

It was my great honor to deliver a message at the Marine Corps Air Station Miramar to our GREAT U. S.  Military, straight from the heart of the American People: We support you, we thank you, we love you - and we will always have your back!. 

If we don’t have a wall system, we’re not going to have a country.  Congress must fund the BORDER WALL & prohibit grants to sanctuary jurisdictions that threaten the security of our country & the people of our country.  We must enforce our laws & protect our people!  #BuildTheWall. 

California’s sanctuary policies are illegal and unconstitutional and put the safety and security of our entire nation at risk.  Thousands of dangerous & violent criminal aliens are released as a result of sanctuary policies, set free to prey on innocent Americans.  THIS MUST STOP! 

“According to the Center for Immigration Studies, the $18 billion wall will pay for itself by curbing the importation of crime, drugs and illegal immigrants who tend to go on the federal dole... ”. 

Heading to see the BORDER WALL prototypes in California!. 

Mike Pompeo, Director of the CIA, will become our new Secretary of State.  He will do a fantastic job!  Thank you to Rex Tillerson for his service!  Gina Haspel will become the new Director of the CIA, and the first woman so chosen.  Congratulations to all! 

The Economy is raging, at an all time high, and is set to get even better.  Jobs and wages up.  Vote for Rick Saccone and keep it going! 

THE HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE HAS, AFTER A 14 MONTH LONG IN-DEPTH INVESTIGATION, FOUND NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION OR COORDINATION BETWEEN THE TRUMP CAMPAIGN AND RUSSIA TO INFLUENCE THE 2016 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION. 

@astros It was my great honor to welcome the 2017 World Series Champion Houston @Astros to the @WhiteHouse!  #HoustonStrong. 

The Pittsburgh Post Gazette just endorsed Rick Saccone for Congress.  He will be much better for steel and business.  Very strong on experience and what our Country needs.  Lamb will always vote for Pelosi and Dems.... Will raise taxes, weak on Crime and Border. 

If schools are mandated to be gun free zones, violence and danger are given an open invitation to enter.  Almost all school shootings are in gun free zones.  Cowards will only go where there is no deterrent! 

.... On 18 to 21 Age Limits, watching court cases and rulings before acting.  States are making this decision.  Things are moving rapidly on this, but not much political support (to put it mildly). 

Very strong improvement and strengthening of background checks will be fully backed by White House.  Legislation moving forward.  Bump Stocks will soon be out.  Highly trained expert teachers will be allowed to conceal carry, subject to State Law.  Armed guards OK, deterrent!....... 

Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross will be speaking with representatives of the European Union about eliminating the large Tariffs and Barriers they use against the U. S. A.  Not fair to our farmers and manufacturers. 

Rasmussen and others have my approval ratings at around 50%, which is higher than Obama, and yet the political pundits love saying my approval ratings are “somewhat low. ” They know they are lying when they say it.  Turn off the show - FAKE NEWS! 

The Democrats continue to Obstruct the confirmation of hundreds of good and talented people who are needed to run our government... A record in U. S.  history.  State Department, Ambassadors and many others are being slow walked.  Senate must approve NOW! 

The Republicans are 5-0 in recent Congressional races, a point which the Fake News Media continuously fails to mention.  I backed and campaigned for all of the winners.  They give me credit for one.  Hopefully, Rick Saccone will be another big win on Tuesday. 

... have shown conclusively that there was no Collusion with Russia.. just excuse for losing.  The only Collusion was that done by the DNC, the Democrats and Crooked Hillary.  The writer of the story, Maggie Haberman, a Hillary flunky, knows nothing about me and is not given access. 

The Failing New York Times purposely wrote a false story stating that I am unhappy with my legal team on the Russia case and am going to add another lawyer to help out.  Wrong.  I am VERY happy with my lawyers, John Dowd, Ty Cobb and Jay Sekulow.  They are doing a great job and..... 

@saccone4PA18 Epic crowd in Moon Township, Pennsylvania tonight.  Thank you!  Get out on Tuesday and VOTE for Rick @Saccone4PA18.  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Join me LIVE in Moon Township, Pennsylvania at 7:00pmE.  Great crowd for a #MAGA rally!. 

The European Union, wonderful countries who treat the U. S.  very badly on trade, are complaining about the tariffs on Steel & Aluminum.  If they drop their horrific barriers & tariffs on U. S.  products going in, we will likewise drop ours.  Big Deficit.  If not, we Tax Cars etc.  FAIR! 

In the first hours after hearing that North Korea’s leader wanted to meet with me to talk denuclearization and that missile launches will end, the press was startled & amazed. They couldn’t believe it.  But by the following morning the news became FAKE. They said so what, who cares! 

North Korea has not conducted a Missile Test since November 28, 2017 and has promised not to do so through our meetings.  I believe they will honor that commitment! 

Heading to Moon Township, Pennsylvania, to be with a really good person, State Representative Rick Saccone, who is running for Congress.  Big & happy crowd (why not, some of the best economic numbers ever).  Rick will help me a lot.  Also, tough on crime & border.  Loves 2nd A & VETS\. 

Spoke to Prime Minister Abe of Japan, who is very enthusiastic about talks with North Korea.  Also discussing opening up Japan to much better trade with the U. S.  Currently have a massive $100 Billion Trade Deficit.  Not fair or sustainable.  It will all work out! 

Chinese President XI JINPING and I spoke at length about the meeting with KIM JONG UN of North Korea.  President XI told me he appreciates that the U. S.  is working to solve the problem diplomatically rather than going with the ominous alternative.  China continues to be helpful! 

Congratulations to Kristian Saucier, a man who has served proudly in the Navy, on your newly found Freedom.  Now you can go out and have the life you deserve! 

We are deeply saddened by the tragic situation in Yountville and mourn the loss of three incredible women who cared for our Veterans. 

The deal with North Korea is very much in the making and will be, if completed, a very good one for the World.  Time and place to be determined. 

Spoke to PM @TurnbullMalcolm of Australia.  He is committed to having a very fair and reciprocal military and trade relationship.  Working very quickly on a security agreement so we don’t have to impose steel or aluminum tariffs on our ally, the great nation of Australia! 

That’s right @RepBost!  Thank you for your support in helping put America back to work.  It’s about JOBS, JOBS, JOBS for our incredible workers and putting AMERICA FIRST!. 

@saccone4PA18 Look forward to being in Pennsylvania tomorrow in support of Rick @Saccone4PA18.  Big crowd expected in Moon Township.  Vote Rick and see you there!  #MAGA\. 

JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!  #MAGA. 

Kim Jong Un talked about denuclearization with the South Korean Representatives, not just a freeze.  Also, no missile testing by North Korea during this period of time.  Great progress being made but sanctions will remain until an agreement is reached.  Meeting being planned! 

“Presidential Proclamation on Adjusting Imports of Aluminum into the United States”  Proclamation. 

“Presidential Proclamation on Adjusting Imports of Steel into the United States” Proclamation. 

Great meeting with @Cabinet at the @WhiteHouse today!  #MAGA. 

Happy #InternationalWomensDay“First Lady Melania Trump to Present the 2018 International Women of Courage Award”. 

Looking forward to 3:30 P. M.  meeting today at the White House.  We have to protect & build our Steel and Aluminum Industries while at the same time showing great flexibility and cooperation toward those that are real friends  and treat us fairly on both trade and the military. 

The U. S.  is acting swiftly on Intellectual Property theft.  We cannot allow this to happen as it has for many years! 

China has been asked to develop a plan for the year of a One Billion Dollar reduction in their massive Trade Deficit with the United States.  Our relationship with China has been a very good one, and we look forward to seeing what ideas they come back with.  We must act soon! 

From Bush 1 to present, our Country has lost more than 55,000 factories, 6,000,000 manufacturing jobs and accumulated Trade Deficits of more than 12 Trillion Dollars.  Last year we had a Trade Deficit of almost 800 Billion Dollars.  Bad Policies & Leadership.  Must WIN again!   #MAGA\.

Great couple, great book!. 

Possible progress being made in talks with North Korea.  For the first time in many years, a serious effort is being made by all parties concerned.  The World is watching and waiting!  May be false hope, but the U. S.  is ready to go hard in either direction! 

Federal Judge in Maryland has just ruled that “President Trump has the right to end DACA. ” President Obama had 8 years to fix this problem, and didn’t.  I am waiting for the Dems, they are running for the hills! 

Lowest rated Oscars in HISTORY.  Problem is, we don’t have Stars anymore - except your President (just kidding, of course)! 

We will see what happens!. 

We are getting it done - jobs and security!. 

Total inaction on DACA by Dems.  Where are you?  A deal can be made! 

The new Fake News narrative is that there is CHAOS in the White House.  Wrong!  People will always come & go, and I want strong dialogue before making a final decision.  I still have some people that I want to change (always seeking perfection).  There is no Chaos, only great Energy! 

It’s March 5th and the Democrats are nowhere to be found on DACA.  Gave them 6 months, they just don’t care.  Where are they?  We are ready to make a deal! 

Why did the Obama Administration start an investigation into the Trump Campaign (with zero proof of wrongdoing) long before the Election in November?  Wanted to discredit so Crooked H would win.  Unprecedented.  Bigger than Watergate!  Plus, Obama did NOTHING about Russian meddling. 

To protect our Country we must protect American Steel!  #AMERICA FIRST\. 

... treat our farmers much better.  Highly restrictive.  Mexico must do much more on stopping drugs from pouring into the U. S.  They have not done what needs to be done.  Millions of people addicted and dying. 

We have large trade deficits with Mexico and Canada.  NAFTA, which is under renegotiation right now, has been a bad deal for U. S. A.  Massive relocation of companies & jobs.  Tariffs on Steel and Aluminum will only come off if new & fair NAFTA agreement is signed.  Also, Canada must.. 

We are on the losing side of almost all trade deals.  Our friends and enemies have taken advantage of the U. S.  for many years.  Our Steel and Aluminum industries are dead.  Sorry, it’s time for a change!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

The Gridiron Dinner last night was great fun.  I am accomplishing a lot in Washington and have never had a better time doing something, and especially since this is for the American People! 

If the E. U.  wants to further increase their already massive tariffs and barriers on U. S.  companies doing business there, we will simply apply a Tax on their Cars which freely pour into the U. S.  They make it impossible for our cars (and more) to sell there.  Big trade imbalance! 

The United States has an $800 Billion Dollar Yearly Trade Deficit because of our “very stupid” trade deals and policies.  Our jobs and wealth are being given to other countries that have taken advantage of us for years.  They laugh at what fools our leaders have been.  No more! 

Mainstream Media in U. S.  is being mocked all over the world.  They’ve gone CRAZY!. 

Happy National Anthem Day!. 

REST IN PEACE BILLY GRAHAM!. 

When a country Taxes our products coming in at, say, 50%, and we Tax the same product coming into our country at ZERO, not fair or smart.  We will soon be starting RECIPROCAL TAXES so that we will charge the same thing as they charge us.  $800 Billion Trade Deficit-have no choice! 

We must protect our country and our workers.  Our steel industry is in bad shape.  IF YOU DON’T HAVE STEEL, YOU DON’T HAVE A COUNTRY! 

Eric, we are all with you and your family!  Look forward to seeing you back on T. V.. 

Alec Baldwin, whose dying mediocre career was saved by his terrible impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing me was agony.  Alec, it was agony for those who were forced to watch.  Bring back Darrell Hammond, funnier and a far greater talent! 

When a country (USA) is losing many billions of dollars on trade with virtually every country it does business with, trade wars are good, and easy to win.  Example, when we are down $100 billion with a certain country and they get cute, don’t trade anymore-we win big.  It’s easy! 

Good (Great) meeting in the Oval Office tonight with the NRA! 

Manufacturing growing at the fastest pace in almost two decades! 

Jobless claims at a 49 year low! 

Together, we will face this challenge as a national family with conviction, with unity, and with a commitment to love and support our neighbors in times of dire need.  Working together, we will defeat this #OpioidEpidemic. Full Opioid Summit. 

“Consumer Confidence in February Highest Since November 2000”. 

“Manufacturing in U. S.  Expands at Fastest Pace Since May 2004”. 

Unemployment filings are at their lowest level in over 48 years.  Great news for workers and JOBS, JOBS, JOBS!  #MAGA. 

Our Steel and Aluminum industries (and many others) have been decimated by decades of unfair trade and bad policy with countries from around the world.  We must not let our country, companies and workers be taken advantage of any longer.  We want free, fair and SMART TRADE! 

Many ideas, some good & some not so good, emerged from our bipartisan meeting on school safety yesterday at the White House.  Background Checks a big part of conversation.  Gun free zones are proven targets of killers.  After many years, a Bill should emerge.  Respect 2nd Amendment! 

It was an honor to welcome bipartisan members of Congress for a discussion on SAFE schools and SAFE communities.  As we continue to mourn the loss of so many precious young lives in Parkland, we are determined to turn our grief into action.  Full meeting. 

Today we honor Billy Graham as only three private citizens before him have been honored.  We say a prayer for our country: that all across this land, the Lord will raise up men and women like Billy Graham to spread a message of love and hope to every precious child of God.. 

Starting at a small Bible School in Florida, Billy Graham soon led a nationwide revival.  From a large tent in Los Angeles, to one hundred thousand people in a single day at Yankee Stadium, to more than two million people at Madison Square Garden over sixteen weeks in 1957.... 

Today, in the center of this great Chamber lies Billy Graham – an Ambassador for Christ who reminded the world of the power of prayer and the gift of God’s grace.. 

Why is A. G.  Jeff Sessions asking the Inspector General to investigate potentially massive FISA abuse.  Will take forever, has no prosecutorial power and already late with reports on Comey etc.  Isn’t the I. G.  an Obama guy?  Why not use Justice Department lawyers?  DISGRACEFUL! 

45 year low on illegal border crossings this year.  Ice and Border Patrol Agents are doing a great job for our Country.  MS-13 thugs being hit hard. 

I have decided that sections of the Wall that California wants built NOW will not be built until the whole Wall is approved.  Big victory yesterday with ruling from the courts that allows us to proceed.  OUR COUNTRY MUST HAVE BORDER SECURITY! 

The Heritage Foundation has just stated that 64% of the Trump Agenda is already done, faster than even Ronald Reagan.  “We’re blown away,” said Thomas Binion of Heritage, President Trump “is very active, very conservative and very effective.  Huge volume & spectrum of issues. ”

Big legal win today.  U. S.  judge sided with the Trump Administration and rejected the attempt to stop the government from building a great Border Wall on the Southern Border.  Now this important project can go forward! 

Such a beautiful map, thank you!. 

. @SenatorWicker of Mississippi has been a great supporter and incredible help in getting our massive Tax Cut Bill done and approved.  Also big help on cutting regs.  I am with him in his re-election all the way! 

Texas LC George P.  Bush backed me when it wasn’t the politically correct thing to do, and I back him now.  Also, AC Sid Miller has been with me from the beginning, he is “Trump’s Man in Texas. ” Also support Comptroller Glenn Hegar, and Railroad Commissioner Christi Craddick. 

“American consumers are the most confident they've been since 2000.... A strong job market is boosting confidence.  The unemployment rate has stayed at a 17-year low. ”. 

I want to encourage all of my many Texas friends to vote in the primary for Governor Greg Abbott, Senator Ted Cruz, Lt.  Gov.  Dan Patrick, and Attorney General Ken Paxton.  They are helping me to Make America Great Again!  Vote early or on March 6th. 

WITCH HUNT! 

“We’ve seen NO EVIDENCE OF COLLUSION.... I have seen nothing, the firing of James Comey and all of the aftermath, that suggests that the President has obstructed justice because he’s exercising his power as the President of the U. S.  I just don’t see it. ”  Judge Ken Starr\. 

“I’ve been skeptical about the collusion and obstruction claims for the last year.  I just don’t see the evidence.... in terms of the collusion, it’s all a bit implausible based on the evidence we have. ”  Jonathan Turley on @FoxNews\. 

“He’s got a very good point.  Somebody in the Justice Department has a treasure trove of evidence of Mrs.  Clinton’s criminality at her own hands, or through others, that ought to be investigated.  I fully agree with the President on that. ” @judgenapolitano on @marthamaccallum Show\. 

I will be interviewed by @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews at 9:00 P. M.  Enjoy! 

“Congressman Schiff omitted and distorted key facts” @FoxNews  So, what else is new.  He is a total phony! 

“Russians had no compromising information on Donald Trump” @FoxNews  Of course not, because there is none, and never was.  This whole Witch Hunt is an illegal disgrace... and Obama did nothing about Russia! 

Dem Memo: FBI did not disclose who the clients were - the Clinton Campaign and the DNC.  Wow! 

The Democrat memo response on government surveillance abuses is a total political and legal BUST.  Just confirms all of the terrible things that were done.  SO ILLEGAL! 

BIG CPAC STRAW POLL RESULTS: 93% APPROVE OF THE JOB PRESIDENT TRUMP IS DOING (Thank you! ).  50% say President Trump should Tweet MORE or SAME (funny! ).  79% say Republicans in Congress should do a better job of working with President Trump (starting to happen). 

Dems are no longer talking DACA!  “Out of sight, out of mind,” they say.  DACA beneficiaries should not be happy.  Nancy Pelosi truly doesn’t care about them.  Republicans stand ready to make a deal! 

Unemployment claims are at the lowest level since 1973.  Much of this has to do with the massive cutting of unnecessary and job killing Regulations! 

Democrat judges have totally redrawn election lines in the great State of Pennsylvania.  @FoxNews.  This is very unfair to Republicans and to our country as a whole.  Must be appealed to the United States Supreme Court ASAP! 

Armed Educators (and trusted people who work within a school) love our students and will protect them.  Very smart people.  Must be firearms adept & have annual training.  Should get yearly bonus.  Shootings will not happen again - a big & very inexpensive deterrent.  Up to States. 

So true Wayne, and Lowest black unemployment in history!. 

Thank you to the great men and women of the United States @SecretService for a job well done! 

Today, @FLOTUS Melania and I were honored to welcome Prime Minister @TurnbullMalcolm and Mrs.  Turnbull of Australia to the @WhiteHouse! <Emoji: Flag of United States><Emoji: Flag of Australia>Press Conference. 

Our nation’s motto is IN GOD WE TRUST.  This week, our nation lost an incredible leader who devoted his life to helping us understand what those words really mean.  We will never forget the historic crowds, the voice, the energy, and the profound faith of Billy Graham!  #CPAC2018. 

We salute our great American flag, we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of Allegiance, and we all PROUDLY STAND for the National Anthem.  #CPAC2018. 

After years of rebuilding OTHER nations, we are finally rebuilding OUR nation - and we are restoring our confidence and our pride!  #CPAC2018. 

For those of you who are still interested, the Democrats have totally forgotten about DACA.  Not a lot of interest on this subject from them! 

My daughter, Ivanka, just arrived in South Korea.  We cannot have a better, or smarter, person representing our country. 

CPAC Today! 

MS-13 gang members are being removed by our Great ICE and Border Patrol Agents by the thousands, but these killers come back in from El Salvador, and through Mexico, like water.  El Salvador just takes our money, and Mexico must help MORE with this problem.  We need The Wall! 

“School shooting survivor says he quit @CNN Town Hall after refusing scripted question. ” @TuckerCarlson.  Just like so much of CNN, Fake News.  That’s why their ratings are so bad!  MSNBC may be worse. 

Today, it was my great honor to host a School Safety Roundtable at the @WhiteHouse with State and local leaders, law enforcement officers, and education officials. There is nothing more important than protecting our children.  They deserve to be safe, and we will deliver!. 

On behalf of an entire Nation, CONGRATULATIONS to the U. S.  Women's Hockey Team on winning the GOLD!  #GoTeamUSA #Olympics. 

Will be meeting with Lawmakers today at 11:30 A. M.  to discuss School Safety.   Next week it will be with our Nation’s Governors.  It’s been many years of all talk, no action.  We’ll get it done! 

What many people don’t understand, or don’t want to understand, is that Wayne, Chris and the folks who work so hard at the @NRA are Great People and Great American Patriots.  They love our Country and will do the right thing.                   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

I will be strongly pushing Comprehensive Background Checks with an emphasis on Mental Health.  Raise age to 21 and end sale of Bump Stocks!  Congress is in a mood to finally do something on this issue - I hope! 

.... If a potential “sicko shooter” knows that a school has a large number of very weapons talented teachers (and others) who will be instantly shooting, the sicko will NEVER attack that school.  Cowards won’t go there... problem solved.  Must be offensive, defense alone won’t work! 

.... History shows that a school shooting lasts, on average, 3 minutes.  It takes police & first responders approximately 5 to 8 minutes to get to site of crime.  Highly trained, gun adept, teachers/coaches would solve the problem instantly, before police arrive.  GREAT DETERRENT! 

.... immediately fire back if a savage sicko came to a school with bad intentions.  Highly trained teachers would also serve as a deterrent to the cowards that do this.  Far more assets at much less cost than guards.  A “gun free” school is a magnet for bad people.  ATTACKS WOULD END! 

@nbc I never said “give teachers guns” like was stated on Fake News @CNN & @NBC.  What I said was to look at the possibility of giving “concealed guns to gun adept teachers with military or special training experience - only the best.  20% of teachers, a lot, would now be able to\. 

I will always remember the time I spent today with courageous students, teachers and families.  So much love in the midst of so much pain.  We must not let them down.  We must keep our children safe!! Full Listening Session. 

. @FLOTUS Melania and I join millions of people around the world in mourning the passing of Billy Graham.  Our prayers are with his children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren and all who worked closely with Reverend Graham in his lifelong ministry.. 

Yesterday, it was my great honor to recognize extraordinary Law Enforcement Officers and First Responders, and to award them the the highest possible decoration for bravery by public safety officers, the Medal of Valor.  #AmericanHeroes. 

Question: If all of the Russian meddling took place during the Obama Administration, right up to January 20th, why aren’t they the subject of the investigation?  Why didn’t Obama do something about the meddling?  Why aren’t Dem crimes under investigation?  Ask Jeff Sessions! 

The GREAT Billy Graham is dead.  There was nobody like him!  He will be missed by Christians and all religions.  A very special man. 

@MSNBC @CNN Whether we are Republican or Democrat, we must now focus on strengthening Background Checks! 

So true, thank you!. 

Bad ratings @CNN & @MSNBC got scammed when they covered the anti-Trump Russia rally wall-to-wall.  They probably knew it was Fake News but, because it was a rally against me, they pushed it hard anyway.  Two really dishonest newscasters, but the public is wise! 

Main Street is BOOMING thanks to our incredible TAX CUT and Reform law.  "This shows small-business owners are more than just optimistic, they are ready to grow their businesses. ". 

.... cameras running.  Another False Accusation.  Why doesn’t @washingtonpost report the story of the women taking money to make up stories about me?  One had her home mortgage paid off.  Only @FoxNews so reported... doesn’t fit the Mainstream Media narrative. 

A woman I don’t know and, to the best of my knowledge, never met, is on the FRONT PAGE of the Fake News Washington Post saying I kissed her (for two minutes yet) in the lobby of Trump Tower 12 years ago.  Never happened!  Who would do this in a public space with live security...... 

I have been much tougher on Russia than Obama, just look at the facts.  Total Fake News! 

Hope Republicans in the Great State of Pennsylvania challenge the new “pushed” Congressional Map, all the way to the Supreme Court, if necessary.  Your Original was correct!  Don’t let the Dems take elections away from you so that they can raise taxes & waste money! 

Matt Schlapp and CPAC are getting ready for another exciting event.  Big difference from those days when President Obama held the White House.  You’ve come a long way Matt! 

Republicans are now leading the Generic Poll, perhaps because of the popular Tax Cuts which the Dems want to take away.  Actually, they want to raise you taxes, substantially.  Also, they want to do nothing on DACA, R’s want to fix! 

.... The President Obama quote just before election.  That’s because he thought Crooked Hillary was going to win and he didn’t want to “rock the boat. ” When I easily won the Electoral College, the whole game changed and the Russian excuse became the narrative of the Dems. 

“There is no serious person out there who would suggest somehow that you could even rig America’s elections, there’s no evidence that that has happened in the past or that it will happen this time, and so I’d invite Mr.  Trump to stop whining and make his case to get votes. ” ..... 

Thank you to @foxandfriends for the great timeline on all of the failures the Obama Administration had against Russia, including Crimea, Syria and so much more.  We are now starting to win again! 

“The Faith of Donald Trump,” a book just out by David Brody and Scott Lamb, is a very interesting read.  Enjoy! 

The U. S.  economy is looking very good, in my opinion, even better than anticipated.  Companies are pouring back into our country, reversing the long term trend of leaving.  The unemployment numbers are looking great, and Regulations & Taxes have been massively Cut!  JOBS, JOBS, JOBS\. 

. @MittRomney has announced he is running for the Senate from the wonderful State of Utah.  He will make a great Senator and worthy successor to @OrrinHatch, and has my full support and endorsement! 

Obama was President up to, and beyond, the 2016 Election.  So why didn’t he do something about Russian meddling? 

Have a great, but very reflective, President’s Day! 

Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes.  The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect.  Hope Oprah runs so she can be exposed and defeated just like all of the others! 

My great friends from NASCAR are having their big race today, The Daytona 500.  Brian France and the France family are special people.  Enjoy the race! 

Thank you to KenStarr, former Independent Counsel, Whitewater, for your insight and powerful words on FISA abuse, Russian meddling etc.  Really great interview with @MariaBartiromo\. 

Great Pollster John McLaughlin now has the GOP up in the Generic Congressional Ballot.  Big gain over last 4 weeks.  I guess people are loving the big Tax Cuts given them by the Republicans, the Cuts the Dems want to take away.  We need more Republicans! 

The Fake News of big ratings loser CNN.. 

If it was the GOAL of Russia to create discord, disruption and chaos within the U. S.  then, with all of the Committee Hearings, Investigations and Party hatred, they have succeeded beyond their wildest dreams.  They are laughing their asses off in Moscow.  Get smart America! 

Now that Adam Schiff is starting to blame President Obama for Russian meddling in the election, he is probably doing so as yet another excuse that the Democrats, lead by their fearless leader, Crooked Hillary Clinton, lost the 2016 election.  But wasn’t I a great candidate? 

I never said Russia did not meddle in the election, I said “it may be Russia, or China or another country or group, or it may be a 400 pound genius sitting in bed and playing with his computer. ” The Russian “hoax” was that the Trump campaign colluded with Russia - it never did! 

Finally, Liddle’ Adam Schiff, the leakin’ monster of no control, is now blaming the Obama Administration for Russian meddling in the 2016 Election.  He is finally right about something.  Obama was President, knew of the threat, and did nothing.  Thank you Adam! 

Never gotten over the fact that Obama was able to send $1. 7 Billion Dollars in CASH to Iran and nobody in Congress, the FBI or Justice called for an investigation! 

General McMaster forgot to say that the results of the 2016 election were not impacted or changed by the Russians and that the only Collusion was between Russia and Crooked H, the DNC and the Dems.  Remember the Dirty Dossier, Uranium, Speeches, Emails and the Podesta Company! 

Very sad that the FBI missed all of the many signals sent out by the Florida school shooter.  This is not acceptable.  They are spending too much time trying to prove Russian collusion with the Trump campaign - there is no collusion.  Get back to the basics and make us all proud! 

Just like they don’t want to solve the DACA problem, why didn’t the Democrats pass gun control legislation when they had both the House & Senate during the Obama Administration.  Because they didn’t want to, and now they just talk! 

“I have seen all of the Russian ads and I can say very definitively that swaying the election was *NOT* the main goal. ”Rob GoldmanVice President of Facebook Ads. 

Funny how the Fake News Media doesn’t want to say that the Russian group was formed in 2014, long before my run for President.  Maybe they knew I was going to run even though I didn’t know! 

Deputy A. G.  Rod Rosenstein stated at the News Conference: “There is no allegation in the indictment that any American was a knowing participant in this illegal activity.  There is no allegation in the indictment that the charged conduct altered the outcome of the 2016 election. 

“Charges Deal Don A Big Win,” written by Michael Goodwin of the @nypost, succinctly states that “the Russians had no impact on the election results. ” There was no Collusion with the Trump Campaign.  “She lost the old-fashioned way, by being a terrible candidate.  Case closed. ”

Melania and I met such incredible people last night in Broward County, Florida.  Will never forget them, or the evening! 

Our entire Nation, w/one heavy heart, continues to pray for the victims & their families in Parkland, FL.  To teachers, law enforcement, first responders & medical professionals who responded so bravely in the face of danger: We THANK YOU for your courage!. 

Russia started their anti-US campaign in 2014, long before I announced that I would run for President.  The results of the election were not impacted.  The Trump campaign did nothing wrong - no collusion! 

Cannot believe how BADLY DACA recipients have been treated by the Democrats... totally abandoned!  Republicans are still working hard. 

I will be leaving for Florida today to meet with some of the bravest people on earth - but people whose lives have been totally shattered.  Am also working with Congress on many fronts. 

Presidential Proclamation Honoring the Victims of the Tragedy in Parkland, Florida. 

... lottery, continues deadly catch-and-release, and bars enforcement even for FUTURE illegal immigrants.  Voting for this amendment would be a vote AGAINST law enforcement, and a vote FOR open borders.  If Dems are actually serious about DACA, they should support the Grassley bill! 

The Schumer-Rounds-Collins immigration bill would be a total catastrophe.  @DHSgov says it would be “the end of immigration enforcement in America. ” It creates a giant amnesty (including for dangerous criminals), doesn’t build the wall, expands chain migration, keeps the visa... 

In times of tragedy, the bonds that sustain us are those of family, faith, community, and country.  These bonds are stronger than the forces of hatred and evil - and these bonds grow even stronger in the hours of our greatest need.. 

While the Republicans and Democrats in Congress are working hard to come up with a solution to DACA, they should be strongly considering a system of Merit Based Immigration so that we will have the people ready, willing and able to help all of those companies moving into the USA! 

So many signs that the Florida shooter was mentally disturbed, even expelled from school for bad and erratic behavior.  Neighbors and classmates knew he was a big problem.  Must always report such instances to authorities, again and again! 

Just spoke to Governor Rick Scott.  We are working closely with law enforcement on the terrible Florida school shooting. 

My prayers and condolences to the families of the victims of the terrible Florida shooting.  No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school. 

Today, I was honored to be joined by Republicans and Democrats from both the House and Senate, as well as members of my Cabinet - to discuss the urgent need to rebuild and restore America’s depleted infrastructure.. 

As we come together to celebrate the extraordinary contributions of African-Americans to our nation, our thoughts turn to the heroes of the civil rights movement whose courage and sacrifice have inspired us all.  Proclamation. 

Negotiations on DACA have begun.  Republicans want to make a deal and Democrats say they want to make a deal.  Wouldn’t it be great if we could finally, after so many years, solve the DACA puzzle.  This will be our last chance, there will never be another opportunity!  March 5th. 

Our infrastructure plan has been put forward and has received great reviews by everyone except, of course, the Democrats.  After many years we have taken care of our Military, now we have to fix our roads, bridges, tunnels, airports and more.  Bipartisan, make deal Dems? 

The journey to #MAGA began @CPAC 2011 and the opportunity to reconnect with friends and supporters is something I look forward to every year.  See you at #CPAC2018! 

Thank you to Sue Kruczek, who lost her wonderful and talented son Nick to the Opioid scourge, for your kind words while on @foxandfriends.  We are fighting this terrible epidemic hard - Nick will not have died in vain! 

This will be a big week for Infrastructure.  After so stupidly spending $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is now time to start investing in OUR Country! 

Just spoke to @JohnKasich to express condolences and prayers to all for the horrible shooting of two great police officers from @WestervillePD.  This is a true tragedy! 

Rep.  Lou Barletta, a Great Republican from Pennsylvania who was one of my very earliest supporters, will make a FANTASTIC Senator.  He is strong & smart, loves Pennsylvania & loves our Country!  Voted for Tax Cuts, unlike Bob Casey, who listened to Tax Hikers Pelosi and Schumer! 

4. 2 million hard working Americans have already received a large Bonus and/or Pay Increase because of our recently Passed Tax Cut & Jobs Bill.... and it will only get better!  We are far ahead of schedule. 

So many positive things going on for the U. S. A.  and the Fake News Media just doesn’t want to go there.  Same negative stories over and over again!  No wonder the People no longer trust the media, whose approval ratings are correctly at their lowest levels in history!     #MAGA\. 

My Administration has identified three major priorities for creating a safe, modern and lawful immigration system: fully securing the border, ending chain migration, and canceling the visa lottery.  Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.. 

My thoughts and prayers are with the two police officers, their families, and everybody at the @WestervillePD.. 

Republicans want to fix DACA far more than the Democrats do.  The Dems had all three branches of government back in 2008-2011, and they decided not to do anything about DACA.  They only want to use it as a campaign issue.  Vote Republican! 

.... agencies, not just the FBI & DOJ, now the State Department to dig up dirt on him in the days leading up to the Election.  Comey had conversations with Donald Trump, which I don’t believe were accurate... he leaked information (corrupt). ” Tom Fitton of Judicial Watch on @FoxNews\. 

“My view is that not only has Trump been vindicated in the last several weeks about the mishandling of the Dossier and the lies about the Clinton/DNC Dossier, it shows that he’s been victimized.  He’s been victimized by the Obama Administration who were using all sorts of....... 

Peoples lives are being shattered and destroyed by a mere allegation.  Some are true and some are false.  Some are old and some are new.  There is no recovery for someone falsely accused - life and career are gone.  Is there no such thing any longer as Due Process? 

According to the @nytimes, a Russian sold phony secrets on “Trump” to the U. S.  Asking price was $10 million, brought down to $1 million to be paid over time.  I hope people are now seeing & understanding what is going on here.  It is all now starting to come out - DRAIN THE SWAMP! 

The Democrats sent a very political and long response memo which they knew, because of sources and methods (and more), would have to be heavily redacted, whereupon they would blame the White House for lack of transparency.  Told them to re-do and send back in proper form! 

Jobless claims have dropped to a 45 year low! 

Costs on non-military lines will never come down if we do not elect more Republicans in the 2018 Election, and beyond.  This Bill is a BIG VICTORY for our Military, but much waste in order to get Dem votes.  Fortunately, DACA not included in this Bill, negotiations to start now! 

Without more Republicans in Congress, we were forced to increase spending on things we do not like or want in order to finally, after many years of depletion, take care of our Military.  Sadly, we needed some Dem votes for passage.  Must elect more Republicans in 2018 Election! 

Just signed Bill.  Our Military will now be stronger than ever before.  We love and need our Military and gave them everything — and more.  First time this has happened in a long time.  Also means JOBS, JOBS, JOBS! 

Wow!  -Senator Mark Warner got caught having extensive contact with a lobbyist for a Russian oligarch.  Warner did not want a “paper trail” on a “private” meeting (in London) he requested with Steele of fraudulent Dossier fame.  All tied into Crooked Hillary. 

Time to end the visa lottery.  Congress must secure the immigration system and protect Americans.. 

As long as we open our eyes to God’s grace - and open our hearts to God’s love - then America will forever be the land of the free, the home of the brave, and a light unto all nations.  #NationalPrayerBreakfast. 

I will be meeting with Henry Kissinger at 1:45pm.  Will be discussing North Korea, China and the Middle East. 

Our founders invoked our Creator four times in the Declaration of Independence.  Our currency declares “IN GOD WE TRUST. ” And we place our hands on our hearts as we recite the Pledge of Allegiance and proclaim that we are “One Nation Under God. ” #NationalPrayerBreakfast. 

Will be heading over shortly to make remarks at The National Prayer Breakfast in Washington.  Great religious and political leaders, and many friends, including T. V.  producer Mark Burnett of our wonderful 14 season Apprentice triumph, will be there.  Looking forward to seeing all! 

The Budget Agreement today is so important for our great Military.  It ends the dangerous sequester and gives Secretary Mattis what he needs to keep America Great.  Republicans and Democrats must support our troops and support this Bill! 

Congratulations to the Republic of Korea on what will be a MAGNIFICENT Winter Olympics!  What the South Korean people have built is truly an inspiration!. 

Best wishes to the Republic of Korea on hosting the @Olympics!  What a wonderful opportunity to show everyone that you are a truly GREAT NATION!. 

NEW FBI TEXTS ARE BOMBSHELLS! 

In the “old days,” when good news was reported, the Stock Market would go up.  Today, when good news is reported, the Stock Market goes down.  Big mistake, and we have so much good (great) news about the economy! 

@elonmusk Congratulations @ElonMusk and @SpaceX on the successful #FalconHeavy launch.  This achievement, along with @NASA’s commercial and international partners, continues to show American ingenuity at its best!. 

HAPPY BIRTHDAY to our 40th President of the United States of America, Ronald Reagan!. 

Today, we heard the experiences of law enforcement professionals and community leaders working to combat the threat of MS-13, and the reforms we need from Congress to defeat it.  Watch here. 

We need a 21st century MERIT-BASED immigration system.   Chain migration and the visa lottery are outdated programs that hurt our economic and national security.. 

Polling shows nearly 7 in 10 Americans support an immigration reform package that includes DACA, fully secures the border, ends chain migration & cancels the visa lottery.  If D’s oppose this deal, they aren’t serious about DACA-they just want open borders.. 

My prayers and best wishes are with the family of Edwin Jackson, a wonderful young man whose life was so senselessly taken.  @Colts\. 

So disgraceful that a person illegally in our country killed @Colts linebacker Edwin Jackson.  This is just one of many such preventable tragedies.  We must get the Dems to get tough on the Border, and with illegal immigration, FAST! 

Thanks to the historic TAX CUTS that I signed into law, your paychecks are going way UP, your taxes are going way DOWN, and America is once again OPEN FOR BUSINESS!. 

Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure! 

Any deal on DACA that does not include STRONG border security and the desperately needed WALL is a total waste of time.  March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Dems seem not to care about DACA.  Make a deal! 

Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper!  Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information.  Must be stopped! 

Thank you to @foxandfriends for exposing the truth.  Perhaps that’s why your ratings are soooo much better than your untruthful competition! 

The Democrats are pushing for Universal HealthCare while thousands of people are marching in the UK because their U system is going broke and not working.  Dems want to greatly raise taxes for really bad and non-personal medical care.  No thanks! 

My thoughts and prayers are with all of the victims involved in this mornings train collision in South Carolina.  Thank you to our incredible First Responders for the work they’ve done! 

... a tool of anti-Trump political actors.  This is unacceptable in a democracy and ought to alarm anyone who wants the FBI to be a nonpartisan enforcer of the law.... The FBI wasn’t straight with Congress, as it hid most of these facts from investigators. ” Wall Street Journal\. 

“The four page memo released Friday reports the disturbing fact about how the FBI and FISA appear to have been used to influence the 2016 election and its aftermath.... The FBI failed to inform the FISA court that the Clinton campaign had funded the dossier.... the FBI became.... 

Great jobs numbers and finally, after many years, rising wages- and nobody even talks about them.  Only Russia, Russia, Russia, despite the fact that, after a year of looking, there is No Collusion! 

This memo totally vindicates “Trump” in probe.  But the Russian Witch Hunt goes on and on.  Their was no Collusion and there was no Obstruction (the word now used because, after one year of looking endlessly and finding NOTHING, collusion is dead).  This is an American disgrace! 

Rasmussen just announced that my approval rating jumped to 49%, a far better number than I had in winning the Election, and higher than certain “sacred cows. ” Other Trump polls are way up also.  So why does the media refuse to write this?  Oh well, someday! 

Today, it was my honor to join the great men and women of @DHSgov, @CustomsBorder, @ICEgov and @USCIS at the U. S.  Customs and Border Protection National Targeting Center in Sterling, Virginia.  Fact sheet. 

“Trump the orator outlines the greatness of America to Democrats’ disgust”. 

With 3. 5 million Americans receiving bonuses or other benefits from their employers as a result of TAX CUTS, 2018 is off to great start! <Emoji: White heavy check mark>Unemployment rate at 4. 1%. <Emoji: White heavy check mark>Average earnings up 2. 9% in the last year. <Emoji: White heavy check mark>200,000 new American jobs. <Emoji: White heavy check mark>#MAGA<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

“You had Hillary Clinton and the Democratic Party try to hide the fact that they gave money to GPS Fusion to create a Dossier which was used by their allies in the Obama Administration to convince a Court misleadingly, by all accounts, to spy on the Trump Team. ” Tom Fitton, JW\. 

The top Leadership and Investigators of the FBI and the Justice Department have politicized the sacred investigative process in favor of Democrats and against Republicans - something which would have been unthinkable just a short time ago.  Rank & File are great people! 

The Democrats just aren’t calling about DACA.  Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have to get moving fast, or they’ll disappoint you again.  We have a great chance to make a deal or, blame the Dems!  March 5th is coming up fast. 

Thank you for all of the nice compliments and reviews on the State of the Union speech.  45. 6 million people watched, the highest number in history.  @FoxNews beat every other Network, for the first time ever, with 11. 7 million people tuning in.  Delivered from the heart! 

March 5th is rapidly approaching and the Democrats are doing nothing about DACA.  They Resist, Blame, Complain and Obstruct - and do nothing.  Start pushing Nancy Pelosi and the Dems to work out a DACA fix, NOW! 

Heading to beautiful West Virginia to be with great members of the Republican Party.  Will be planning Infrastructure and discussing Immigration and DACA, not easy when we have no support from the Democrats.  NOT ONE DEM VOTED FOR OUR TAX CUT BILL!  Need more Republicans in ‘18. 

Join me live for the #SOTU. 

Congratulations to America’s new Secretary of @HHSGov, Alex Azar!. 

Our economy is better than it has been in many decades.  Businesses are coming back to America like never before.  Chrysler, as an example, is leaving Mexico and coming back to the USA.  Unemployment is nearing record lows.  We are on the right track! 

Somebody please inform Jay-Z that because of my policies, Black Unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED! 

Democrats are not interested in Border Safety & Security or in the funding and rebuilding of our Military.  They are only interested in Obstruction! 

I have offered DACA a wonderful deal, including a doubling in the number of recipients & a twelve year pathway to citizenship, for two reasons: (1) Because the Republicans want to fix a long time terrible problem.  (2) To show that Democrats do not want to solve DACA, only use it! 

Taliban targeted innocent Afghans, brave police in Kabul today.  Our thoughts and prayers go to the victims, and first responders.  We will not allow the Taliban to win! 

On Holocaust Remembrance Day we mourn and grieve the murder of 6 million innocent Jewish men, women and children, and the millions of others who perished in the evil Nazi Genocide.  We pledge with all of our might and resolve: Never Again!. 

Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for his strong statement on @foxandfriends that we very badly NEED THE WALL.  Must also end loophole of “catch & release” and clean up the legal and other procedures at the border NOW for Safety & Security reasons. 

@wef Thank you for the wonderful welcome @WEF!  #Davos2018. 

DACA has been made increasingly difficult by the fact that Cryin’ Chuck Schumer took such a beating over the shutdown that he is unable to act on immigration! 

Heading back from a very exciting two days in Davos, Switzerland.  Speech on America’s economic revival was well received.  Many of the people I met will be investing in the U. S. A.!  #MAGA\. 

Join me live at the 2018 World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland!  #WEF18. 

@alain_berset Great bilateral meeting with President @Alain_Berset of the Swiss Confederation - as we continue to strengthen our great friendship.  Such an honor to be in Switzerland!  #WEF18. 

It was an honor to meet with Republic of Rwanda President Paul Kagame this morning in Davos, Switzerland.  Many great discussions!  #WEF18. 

Will be interviewed on  @SquawkCNBC by @JoeSquawk coming up at 6:00amE from Davos, Switzerland.  Enjoy!  #WEF18. 

Today, Americans everywhere remember the brave men and women of @NASA who lost their lives in our Nation’s eternal quest to expand the boundaries of human potential.. 

@netanyahu Very productive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Benjamin @Netanyahu of Israel - in Davos, Switzerland!  #WEF18. 

Great bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Theresa May of the United Kingdom, affirming the special relationship and our commitment to work together on key national security challenges and economic opportunities.  #WEF18. 

Will soon be heading to Davos, Switzerland, to tell the world how great America is and is doing.  Our economy is now booming and with all I am doing, will only get better... Our country is finally WINNING again! 

It was my great honor to welcome Mayor’s from across America to the WH.  My Administration will always support local government - and listen to the leaders who know their communities best.  Together, we will usher in a bold new era of Peace and Prosperity!. 

Earlier today, I spoke with @GovMattBevin of Kentucky regarding yesterday’s shooting at Marshall County High School.  My thoughts and prayers are with Bailey Holt, Preston Cope, their families, and all of the wounded victims who are in recovery.  We are with you! 

Tremendous investment by companies from all over the world being made in America.  There has never been anything like it.  Now Disney, J. P.  Morgan Chase and many others.  Massive Regulation Reduction and Tax Cuts are making us a powerhouse again.  Long way to go!  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! 

Cryin’ Chuck Schumer fully understands, especially after his humiliating defeat, that if there is no Wall, there is no DACA.  We must have safety and security, together with a strong Military, for our great people! 

Where are the 50,000 important text messages between FBI lovers Lisa Page and Peter Strzok?   Blaming Samsung! 

Thank you to General John Kelly, who is doing a fantastic job, and all of the Staff and others in the White House, for a job well done.  Long hours and Fake reporting makes your job more difficult, but it is always great to WIN, and few have won more than us! 

Nobody knows for sure that the Republicans & Democrats will be able to reach a deal on DACA by February 8, but everyone will be trying.... with a big additional focus put on Military Strength and Border Security.  The Dems have just learned that a Shutdown is not the answer! 

In one of the biggest stories in a long time, the FBI now says it is missing five months worth of lovers Strzok-Page texts, perhaps 50,000, and all in prime time.  Wow! 

Even Crazy Jim Acosta of Fake News CNN agrees: “Trump World and WH sources dancing in end zone: Trump wins again... Schumer and Dems caved... gambled and lost. ” Thank you for your honesty Jim! 

Big win for Republicans as Democrats cave on Shutdown.  Now I want a big win for everyone, including Republicans, Democrats and DACA, but especially for our Great Military and Border Security.  Should be able to get there.  See you at the negotiating table! 

End the Democrats Obstruction!. 

Democrats have shut down our government in the interests of their far left base.  They don’t want to do it but are powerless! 

The Democrats are turning down services and security for citizens in favor of services and security for non-citizens.  Not good! 

Thank you to Brad Blakeman on @FoxNews for grading year one of my presidency with an “A”-and likewise to Doug Schoen for the very good grade and statements.  Working hard! 

Great to see how hard Republicans are fighting for our Military and Safety at the Border.  The Dems just want illegal immigrants to pour into our nation unchecked.  If stalemate continues, Republicans should go to 51% (Nuclear Option) and vote on real, long term budget, no C. R. ’s! 

Eric Trump on @JudgeJeanine on @FoxNews now! 

The Trump Administration has terminated more UNNECESSARY Regulation, in just twelve months, than any other Administration has terminated during their full term in office, no matter what the length.  The good news is, THERE IS MUCH MORE TO COME! 

Unprecedented success for our Country, in so many ways, since the Election.  Record Stock Market, Strong on Military, Crime, Borders, & ISIS, Judicial Strength & Numbers, Lowest Unemployment for Women & ALL, Massive Tax Cuts, end of Individual Mandate - and so much more.  Big 2018! 

Beautiful weather all over our great country, a perfect day for all Women to March.  Get out there now to celebrate the historic milestones and unprecedented economic success and wealth creation that has taken place over the last 12 months.  Lowest female unemployment in 18 years! 

Democrats are holding our Military hostage over their desire to have unchecked illegal immigration.  Can’t let that happen! 

#AMERICA FIRST! 

For those asking, the Republicans only have 51 votes in the Senate, and they need 60.  That is why we need to win more Republicans in 2018 Election!  We can then be even tougher on  Crime (and Border), and even better to our Military & Veterans! 

This is the One Year Anniversary of my Presidency and the Democrats wanted to give me a nice present.  #DemocratShutdown\. 

Democrats are far more concerned with Illegal Immigrants than they are with our great Military or Safety at our dangerous Southern Border.  They could have easily made a deal but decided to play Shutdown politics instead.  #WeNeedMoreRepublicansIn18 in order to power through mess! 

Not looking good for our great Military or Safety & Security on the very dangerous Southern Border.  Dems want a Shutdown in order to help diminish the great success of the Tax Cuts, and what they are doing for our booming economy. 

Excellent preliminary meeting in Oval with @SenSchumer - working on solutions for Security and our great Military together with @SenateMajLdr McConnell and @SpeakerRyan.  Making progress - four week extension would be best! 

Just signed 702 Bill to reauthorize foreign intelligence collection.  This is NOT the same FISA law that was so wrongly abused during the election.  I will always do the right thing for our country and put the safety of the American people first! 

Today, I was honored and proud to address the 45th Annual @March_for_Life!  You are living witnesses of this year’s March for Life theme: #LoveSavesLives.. 

“Shutting down the government is a very serious thing.  People die, accidents happen.  I don’t know how I would vote right now on a CR, OK? ”Sen.  Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif). 

. @WhiteHouse Briefing with Director Marc Short and Director Mick Mulvaney.... 

Government Funding Bill past last night in the House of Representatives.  Now Democrats are needed if it is to pass in the Senate - but they want illegal immigration and weak borders.  Shutdown coming?  We need more Republican victories in 2018! 

House of Representatives needs to pass Government Funding Bill tonight.  So important for our country - our Military needs it! 

AMERICA will once again be a NATION that thinks big, dreams bigger, and always reaches for the stars.  YOU are the ones who will shape America’s destiny.  YOU are the ones who will restore our prosperity.  And YOU are the ones who are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  #MAGA. 

Departing Pittsburgh now, where it was my great honor to stand with our incredible workers, and to show the world that AMERICA is back - and we are coming back bigger and better and stronger than ever before!. 

A government shutdown will be devastating to our military... something the Dems care very little about! 

CHIP should be part of a long term solution, not a 30 Day, or short term, extension! 

We need the Wall for the safety and security of our country.  We need the Wall to help stop the massive inflow of drugs from Mexico, now rated the number one most dangerous country in the world.  If there is no Wall, there is no Deal! 

Will be going to Pennsylvania today in order to give my total support to RICK SACCONE, running for Congress in a Special Election (March 13).  Rick is a great guy.  We need more Republicans to continue our already successful agenda! 

.... The Wall will be paid for, directly or indirectly, or through longer term reimbursement, by Mexico, which has a ridiculous $71 billion dollar trade surplus with the U. S.  The $20 billion dollar Wall is “peanuts” compared to what Mexico makes from the U. S.  NAFTA is a bad joke! 

The Wall is the Wall, it has never changed or evolved from the first day I conceived of it.  Parts will be, of necessity, see through and it was never intended to be built in areas where there is natural protection such as mountains, wastelands or tough rivers or water..... 

ISIS is in retreat, our economy is booming, investments and jobs are pouring back into the country, and so much more!  Together there is nothing we can’t overcome--even a very biased media.  We ARE Making America Great Again! 

Despite some very corrupt and dishonest media coverage, there are many great reporters I respect and lots of GOOD NEWS for the American people to be proud of! 

And the FAKE NEWS winners are.... 

Main Street is BACK!  Strongest Holiday Sales bump since the Great Recession -- beating forecasts by BILLIONS OF DOLLARS.. 

During the campaign, I promised to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN by bringing businesses and jobs back to our country.  I am very proud to see companies like Chrysler moving operations from Mexico to Michigan where there are so many great American workers!. 

I promised that my policies would allow companies like Apple to bring massive amounts of money back to the United States.  Great to see Apple follow through as a result of TAX CUTS.  Huge win for American workers and the USA!. 

Today, we witnessed an incredible moment in history – the presentation of Congress’ highest civilian honor to our friend, and true AMERICAN HERO, Bob Dole.  #CongressionalGoldMedal. 

Eric Trump on @foxandfriends  now! 

.... we need to keep America safe, including moving away from a random chain migration and lottery system, to one that is merit-based.. 

New report from DOJ & DHS shows that nearly 3 in 4 individuals convicted of terrorism-related charges are foreign-born.  We have submitted to Congress a list of resources and reforms.... 

Today, it was my honor to welcome President Nursultan Nazarbayev of Kazakhstan to the @WhiteHouse!. 

“President Donald J.  Trump Proclaims January 16, 2018, as Religious Freedom Day”. 

Unemployment for Black Americans is the lowest ever recorded.  Trump approval ratings with Black Americans has doubled.  Thank you, and it will get even (much) better!  @FoxNews\. 

“90% of Trump 2017 news coverage was negative” -and much of it contrived! @foxandfriends\. 

Do you notice the Fake News Mainstream Media never likes covering the great and record setting economic news, but rather talks about anything negative or that can be turned into the negative.  The Russian Collusion Hoax is dead, except as it pertains to the Dems.  Public gets it! 

The Democrats want to shut down the Government over Amnesty for all and Border Security.  The biggest loser will be our rapidly rebuilding Military, at a time we need it more than ever.  We need a merit based system of immigration, and we need it now!  No more dangerous Lottery. 

We must have Security at our VERY DANGEROUS SOUTHERN BORDER, and we must have a great WALL to help protect us, and to help stop the massive inflow of drugs pouring into our country! 

Senator Dicky Durbin totally misrepresented what was said at the DACA meeting.  Deals can’t get made when there is no trust!  Durbin blew DACA and is hurting our Military. 

... to stop drugs, they want to take money away from our military which we cannot do. ” My standard is very simple, AMERICA FIRST & MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Statement by me last night in Florida: “Honestly, I don’t think the Democrats want to make a deal.  They talk about DACA, but they don’t want to help.. We are ready, willing and able to make a deal but they don’t want to.  They don’t want security at the border, they don’t want..... 

... big unnecessary regulation cuts made it all possible” (among many other things).  “President Trump reversed the policies of President Obama, and reversed our economic decline. ” Thank you Stuart Varney.   @foxandfriends\. 

“President Trump is not getting the credit he deserves for the economy.  Tax Cut bonuses to more than 2,000,000 workers.  Most explosive Stock Market rally that we’ve seen in modern times.  18,000 to 26,000 from Election, and grounded in profitability and growth.  All Trump, not 0... 

I, as President, want people coming into our Country who are going to help us become strong and great again, people coming in through a system based on MERIT.  No more Lotteries!  #AMERICA FIRST\. 

DACA is probably dead because the Democrats don’t really want it, they just want to talk and take desperately needed money away from our Military. 

... and they knew exactly what I said and meant.  They just wanted a story.  FAKE NEWS! 

The Wall Street Journal stated falsely that I said to them “I have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un” (of N.  Korea).  Obviously I didn’t say that.  I said “I’d have a good relationship with Kim Jong Un,” a big difference.  Fortunately we now record conversations with reporters... 

So much Fake News is being reported.  They don’t even try to get it right, or correct it when they are wrong.  They promote the Fake Book of a mentally deranged author, who knowingly writes false information.  The Mainstream Media is crazed that WE won the election! 

I don’t believe the Democrats really want to see a deal on DACA.  They are all talk and no action.  This is the time but, day by day, they are blowing the one great opportunity they have.  Too bad! 

AMERICA FIRST! 

The Democrats are all talk and no action.  They are doing nothing to fix DACA.  Great opportunity missed.  Too bad! 

Yesterday was a big day for the stock market.  Jobs are coming back to America.  Chrysler is coming back to the USA, from Mexico and many others will follow.  Tax cut money to employees is pouring into our economy with many more companies announcing.  American business is hot again! 

Today, it was my great honor to proclaim January 15, 2018, as Martin Luther King Jr. , Federal Holiday.  I encourage all Americans to observe this day with appropriate civic, community, and service activities in honor of Dr.  King's life and legacy.. 

Never said anything derogatory about Haitians other than Haiti is, obviously, a very poor and troubled country.  Never said “take them out. ” Made up by Dems.  I have a wonderful relationship with Haitians.  Probably should record future meetings - unfortunately, no trust! 

Sadly, Democrats want to stop paying our troops and government workers in order to give a sweetheart deal, not a fair deal, for DACA.  Take care of our Military, and our Country, FIRST! 

The language used by me at the DACA meeting was tough, but this was not the language used.  What was really tough was the outlandish proposal made - a big setback for DACA! 

.... Because of the Democrats not being interested in life and safety, DACA has now taken a big step backwards.  The Dems will threaten “shutdown,” but what they are really doing is shutting down our military, at a time we need it most.  Get smart, MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

.... countries which are doing badly.  I want a merit based system of immigration and people who will help take our country to the next level.  I want safety and security for our people.  I want to stop the massive inflow of drugs.  I want to fund our military, not do a Dem defund.... 

The so-called bipartisan DACA deal presented yesterday to myself and a group of Republican Senators and Congressmen was a big step backwards.  Wall was not properly funded, Chain & Lottery were made worse and USA would be forced to take large numbers of people from high crime..... 

Reason I canceled my trip to London is that I am not a big fan of the Obama Administration having sold perhaps the best located and finest embassy in London for “peanuts,” only to build a new one in an off location for 1. 2 billion dollars.  Bad deal.  Wanted me to cut ribbon-NO! 

The Democrats seem intent on having people and drugs pour into our country from the Southern Border, risking thousands of lives in the process.  It is my duty to protect the lives and safety of all Americans.  We must build a Great Wall, think Merit and end Lottery & Chain.  USA! 

Democrat Dianne Feinstein should never have released secret committee testimony to the public without authorization.  Very disrespectful to committee members and possibly illegal.  She blamed her poor decision on the fact she had a cold - a first! 

Chrysler is moving a massive plant from Mexico to Michigan, reversing a years long opposite trend.  Thank you Chrysler, a very wise decision.  The voters in Michigan are very happy they voted for Trump/Pence.  Plenty of more to follow! 

More great news as a result of historical Tax Cuts and Reform: Fiat Chrysler announces plan to invest more than $1 BILLION in Michigan plant, relocating their heavy-truck production from Mexico to Michigan, adding 2,500 new jobs and paying $2,000 bonus to U. S.  employees!. 

Small Business Poll has highest approval numbers in the polls history.  All business is just at the beginning of something really special! 

Thank you Adam Levine, The Federalist, in interview on @foxandfriends  “Donald Trump is the greatest President our Country has ever seen. ”

Yesterday, I signed the #INTERDICTAct (H. R.  2142) with bipartisan members of Congress to help end the flow of drugs into our country.  Together, we are committed to doing everything we can to combat the deadly scourge of drug addiction and overdose in the United States!. 

Great news, as a result of our TAX CUTS & JOBS ACT!. 

With that being said, I have personally directed the fix to the unmasking process since taking office and today’s vote is about foreign surveillance of foreign bad guys on foreign land.  We need it!  Get smart! 

“45 year low in illegal immigration this year. ” @foxandfriends\. 

“House votes on controversial FISA ACT today. ” This is the act that may have been used, with the help of the discredited and phony Dossier, to so badly surveil and abuse the Trump Campaign by the previous administration and others? 

In new Quinnipiac Poll, 66% of people feel the economy is “Excellent or Good. ” That is the highest number ever recorded by this poll. 

Disproven and paid for by Democrats “Dossier used to spy on Trump Campaign.  Did FBI use Intel tool to influence the Election? ” @foxandfriends  Did Dems or Clinton also pay Russians?  Where are hidden and smashed DNC servers?  Where are Crooked Hillary Emails?   What a mess! 

Good news: Toyota and Mazda announce giant new Huntsville, Alabama, plant which will produce over 300,000 cars and SUV’s a year and employ 4000 people.  Companies are coming back to the U. S.  in a very big way.  Congratulations Alabama! 

Cutting taxes and simplifying regulations makes America the place to invest!  Great news as Toyota and Mazda announce they are bringing 4,000 JOBS and investing $1. 6 BILLION in Alabama, helping to further grow our economy!. 

The United States needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval.  The safety and security of our country is #1!. 

Today, it was my great honor to welcome Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway to the @WhiteHouse - a great friend and ally of the United States!  Joint press conference. 

I want to thank my @Cabinet for working tirelessly on behalf of our country.  2017 was a year of monumental achievement and we look forward to the year ahead.  Together, we are delivering results and MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

The single greatest Witch Hunt in American history continues.  There was no collusion, everybody including the Dems knows there was no collusion, & yet on and on it goes.  Russia & the world is laughing at the stupidity they are witnessing.  Republicans should finally take control! 

The fact that Sneaky Dianne Feinstein, who has on numerous occasions stated that collusion between Trump/Russia has not been found, would release testimony in such an underhanded and possibly illegal way, totally without authorization, is a disgrace.  Must have tough Primary! 

It just shows everyone how broken and unfair our Court System is when the opposing side in a case (such as DACA) always runs to the 9th Circuit and almost always wins before being reversed by higher courts. 

. @ICEgov HSI agents and ERO officers, on behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for what you are doing 24/7/365 to keep fellow American’s SAFE.  Everyone is so grateful! #LawEnforcementAppreciationDayPresident @realDonaldTrump. 

Thank you @GOPLeader Kevin McCarthy!  Couldn’t agree w/you more.  TOGETHER, we are #MAGA<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

As I made very clear today, our country needs the security of the Wall on the Southern Border, which must be part of any DACA approval. 

Today, it was my great honor to sign a new Executive Order to ensure Veterans have the resources they need as they transition back to civilian life.  We must ensure that our HEROES are given the care and support they so richly deserve!. 

Thanks to all of the Republican and Democratic lawmakers for today’s very productive meeting on immigration reform.  There was strong agreement to negotiate a bill that deals with border security, chain migration, lottery and DACA.. 

It was my great honor to sign H. R.  267, the “Martin Luther King, Jr.  National Historical Park Act,” which redesignates the Martin Luther King, Junior, National Historic Site in the State of Georgia as the Martin Luther King, Jr.  National Historical Park.. 

On behalf of the American people, THANK YOU to our incredible law enforcement officers.  As President of the United States - I will fight for you, and I will never, ever let you down.  Now, more than ever, we must support the men and women in blue!  #LawEnforcementAppreciationDay. 

We are fighting for our farmers, for our country, and for our GREAT AMERICAN FLAG.  We want our flag respected - and we want our NATIONAL ANTHEM respected also!. 

In every decision we make, we are honoring America’s PROUD FARMING LEGACY.  Years of crushing taxes, crippling regs, & corrupt politics left our communities hurting, our economy stagnant, & millions of hardworking Americans COMPLETELY FORGOTTEN.  But they are not forgotten ANYMORE!. 

We have been working every day to DELIVER for America’s Farmers just as they work every day to deliver FOR US.  #AFBF18. 

Can’t wait to be back in the amazing state of Tennessee to address the 99th American @FarmBureau Federation’s Annual Convention in Nashville!  #AFBF18On my way now - join me LIVE at 4:00pmE. 

African American unemployment is the lowest ever recorded in our country.  The Hispanic unemployment rate dropped a full point in the last year and is close to the lowest in recorded history.  Dems did nothing for you but get your vote!   #NeverForget @foxandfriends\. 

... Clinton in the WH, doubling down on Barack Obama’s failed policies, washes away any doubts that America made the right choice.  This was truly a change election — and the changes Trump is bringing are far-reaching & necessary. ” Thank you Michael Goodwin!. 

“His is turning out to be an enormously consequential presidency.  So much so that, despite my own frustration over his missteps, there has never been a day when I wished Hillary Clinton were president.  Not one.  Indeed, as Trump’s accomplishments accumulate, the mere thought of... 

The Stock Market has been creating tremendous benefits for our country in the form of not only Record Setting Stock Prices, but present and future Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  Seven TRILLION dollars of value created since our big election win! 

The Fake News Awards, those going to the most corrupt & biased of the Mainstream Media, will be presented to the losers on Wednesday, January 17th, rather than this coming Monday.  The interest in, and importance of, these awards is far greater than anyone could have anticipated! 

Jake Tapper of Fake News CNN just got destroyed in his interview with Stephen Miller of the Trump Administration.  Watch the hatred and unfairness of this CNN flunky! 

I’ve had to put up with the Fake News from the first day I announced that I would be running for President.  Now I have to put up with a Fake Book, written by a totally discredited author.  Ronald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well.  So will I! 

Leaving Camp David for the White House.  Great meetings with the Cabinet and Military on many very important subjects including Border Security & the desperately needed Wall, the ever increasing Drug and Opioid Problem, Infrastructure, Military, Budget, Trade and DACA. 

.... to President of the United States (on my first try).  I think that would qualify as not smart, but genius.... and a very stable genius at that! 

.... Actually, throughout my life, my two greatest assets have been mental stability and being, like, really smart.  Crooked Hillary Clinton also played these cards very hard and, as everyone knows, went down in flames.  I went from VERY successful businessman, to top T. V.  Star..... 

Now that Russian collusion, after one year of intense study, has proven to be a total hoax on the American public, the Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook and screaming mental stability and intelligence..... 

Brian Ross, the reporter who made a fraudulent live newscast about me that drove the Stock Market down 350 points (billions of dollars), was suspended for a month but is now back at ABC NEWS in a lower capacity.  He is no longer allowed to report on Trump.  Should have been fired! 

The African American unemployment rate fell to 6. 8%, the lowest rate in 45 years.  I am so happy about this News!  And, in the Washington Post (of all places), headline states, “Trumps first year jobs numbers were very, very good. ”

The Mercer Family recently dumped the leaker known as Sloppy Steve Bannon.  Smart! 

Well, now that collusion with Russia is proving to be a total hoax and the only collusion is with Hillary Clinton and the FBI/Russia, the Fake News Media (Mainstream) and this phony new book are hitting out at every new front imaginable.  They should try winning an election.  Sad! 

Dow goes from 18,589 on November 9, 2016, to 25,075 today, for a new all-time Record.  Jumped 1000 points in last 5 weeks, Record fastest 1000 point move in history.  This is all about the Make America Great Again agenda!  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs.  Six trillion dollars in value created! 

The Fake News Media barely mentions the fact that the Stock Market just hit another New Record and that business in the U. S.  is booming... but the people know!  Can you imagine if “O” was president and had these numbers - would be biggest story on earth!  Dow now over 25,000. 

I authorized Zero access to White House (actually turned him down many times) for author of phony book!  I never spoke to him for book.  Full of lies, misrepresentations and sources that don’t exist.  Look at this guy’s past and watch what happens to him and Sloppy Steve! 

MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Thank you to the great Republican Senators who showed up to our mtg on immigration reform.  We must BUILD THE WALL, stop illegal immigration, end chain migration & cancel the visa lottery.  The current system is unsafe & unfair to the great people of our country - time for change! 

Dow just crashes through 25,000.  Congrats!  Big cuts in unnecessary regulations continuing. 

So beautiful.... Show this picture to the NFL players who still kneel!. 

With all of the failed “experts” weighing in, does anybody really believe that talks and dialogue would be going on between North and South Korea right now if I wasn’t firm, strong and willing to commit our total “might” against the North.  Fools, but talks are a good thing! 

As Americans, you need identification, sometimes in a very strong and accurate form, for almost everything you do..... except when it comes to the most important thing, VOTING for the people that run your country.  Push hard for Voter Identification! 

Many mostly Democrat States refused to hand over data from the 2016 Election to the Commission On Voter Fraud.  They fought hard that the Commission not see their records or methods because they know that many people are voting illegally.  System is rigged, must go to Voter I. D. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Stock Market had another good day but, now that the Tax Cut Bill has passed, we have tremendous upward potential.  Dow just short of 25,000, a number that few thought would be possible this soon into my administration.  Also, unemployment went down to 4. 1%.  Only getting better! 

“Some 40 U. S.  companies have responded to President Trump’s tax cut and reform victory in Congress last year by handing out bonuses up to $2,000, increases in 401k matches and spending on charity, a much higher number than previously known. ”. 

Melania and I are deeply saddened by the death of Thomas S.  Monson, a beloved President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.... 

Such respect for the people of Iran as they try to take back their corrupt government.  You will see great support from the United States at the appropriate time! 

“President Trump has something now he didn’t have a year ago, that is a set of accomplishments that nobody can deny.  The accomplishments are there, look at his record, he has had a very significant first year. ” @LouDobbs Show,David Asman & Ed Rollins\. 

I will be announcing THE MOST DISHONEST & CORRUPT MEDIA AWARDS OF THE YEAR on Monday at 5:00 o’clock.  Subjects will cover Dishonesty & Bad Reporting in various categories from the Fake News Media.  Stay tuned! 

North Korean Leader Kim Jong Un just stated that the “Nuclear Button is on his desk at all times. ” Will someone from his depleted and food starved regime please inform him that I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works! 

... peace treaty with Israel.  We have taken Jerusalem, the toughest part of the negotiation, off the table, but Israel, for that, would have had to pay more.  But with the Palestinians no longer willing to talk peace, why should we make any of these massive future payments to them? 

It's not only Pakistan that we pay billions of dollars to for nothing, but also many other countries, and others.  As an example, we pay the Palestinians HUNDRED OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS a year and get no appreciation or respect.  They don’t even want to negotiate a long overdue... 

Congratulations to Senator Orrin Hatch on an absolutely incredible career.  He has been a tremendous supporter, and I will never forget the (beyond kind) statements he has made about me as President.  He is my friend and he will be greatly missed in the U. S.  Senate!. 

We will not rest until all of America’s GREAT VETERANS can receive the care they so richly deserve.  Tremendous progress has been made in a short period of time.  Keep up the great work @SecShulkin @DeptVetAffairs!. 

Democrats are doing nothing for DACA - just interested in politics.   DACA activists and Hispanics will go hard against Dems, will start “falling in love” with Republicans and their President!  We are about RESULTS. 

.... impartial journalists of a much higher standard, lose all of your phony and non-existent “sources,” and treat the President of the United States FAIRLY, so that the next time I (and the people) win, you won’t have to write an apology to your readers for a job poorly done!  GL\. 

The Failing New York Times has a new publisher, A. G.  Sulzberger.  Congratulations!  Here is a last chance for the Times to fulfill the vision of its Founder, Adolph Ochs, “to give the news impartially, without fear or FAVOR, regardless of party, sect, or interests involved. ” Get... 

Since taking office I have been very strict on Commercial Aviation.  Good news - it was just reported that there were Zero deaths in 2017, the best and safest year on record! 

Sanctions and “other” pressures are beginning to have a big impact on North Korea.  Soldiers are dangerously fleeing to South Korea.  Rocket man now wants to talk to South Korea for first time.  Perhaps that is good news, perhaps not - we will see! 

Companies are giving big bonuses to their workers because of the Tax Cut Bill.  Really great! 

Thank you to Brandon Judd of the National Border Patrol Council for your kind words on how well we are doing at the Border.  We will be bringing in more & more of your great folks and will build the desperately needed WALL!  @foxandfriends\. 

Crooked Hillary Clinton’s top aid, Huma Abedin, has been accused of disregarding basic security protocols.  She put Classified Passwords into the hands of foreign agents.  Remember sailors pictures on submarine?  Jail!  Deep State Justice Dept must finally act?  Also on Comey & others\. 

The people of Iran are finally acting against the brutal and corrupt Iranian regime.  All of the money that President Obama so foolishly gave them went into terrorism and into their “pockets. ” The people have little food, big inflation and no human rights.  The U. S.  is watching! 

Will be leaving Florida for Washington (D. C. ) today at 4:00 P. M.  Much work to be done, but it will be a great New Year! 

Iran is failing at every level despite the terrible deal made with them by the Obama Administration.  The great Iranian people have been repressed for many years.  They are hungry for food & for freedom.  Along with human rights, the wealth of Iran is being looted.  TIME FOR CHANGE! 

The United States has foolishly given Pakistan more than 33 billion dollars in aid over the last 15 years, and they have given us nothing but lies & deceit, thinking of our leaders as fools.  They give safe haven to the terrorists we hunt in Afghanistan, with little help.  No more! 

HAPPY NEW YEAR!  We are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, and much faster than anyone thought possible! 

As our Country rapidly grows stronger and smarter, I want to wish all of my friends, supporters, enemies, haters, and even the very dishonest Fake News Media, a Happy and Healthy New Year.  2018 will be a great year for America! 

Iran, the Number One State of Sponsored Terror with numerous violations of Human Rights occurring on an hourly basis, has now closed down the Internet so that peaceful demonstrators cannot communicate.  Not good! 

What a year it’s been, and we're just getting started.  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Happy New Year!!. 

@dcsheriff My deepest condolences to the victims of the terrible shooting in Douglas County @DCSheriff, and their families.  We love our police and law enforcement - God Bless them all!  #LESM\. 

Why would smart voters want to put Democrats in Congress in 2018 Election when their policies will totally kill the great wealth created during the months since the Election.  People are much better off now not to mention ISIS, VA, Judges, Strong Border, 2nd A, Tax Cuts & more? 

If the Dems (Crooked Hillary) got elected, your stocks would be down 50% from values on Election Day.  Now they have a great future - and just beginning!. 

Big protests in Iran.  The people are finally getting wise as to how their money and wealth is being stolen and squandered on terrorism.  Looks like they will not take it any longer.  The USA is watching very closely for human rights violations! 

“Trump Rally: Stocks put 2017 in the record books”. 

Jobs are kicking in and companies are coming back to the U. S.  Unnecessary regulations and high taxes are being dramatically Cut, and it will only get better.  MUCH MORE TO COME! 

I use Social Media not because I like to, but because it is the only way to fight a VERY dishonest and unfair “press,” now often referred to as Fake News Media.  Phony and non-existent “sources” are being used more often than ever.  Many stories & reports a pure fiction! 

On Taxes: “This is the biggest corporate rate cut ever, going back to the corporate income tax rate of roughly 80 years ago. This is a huge pro-growth stimulus for the economy.  Every year the Obama WH overstated how the economy would grow.  Now real economics and jobs. ” @WSJ Report\. 

Oppressive regimes cannot endure forever, and the day will come when the Iranian people will face a choice.  The world is watching!. 

The entire world understands that the good people of Iran want change, and, other than the vast military power of the United States, that Iran’s people are what their leaders fear the most..... 

Many reports of peaceful protests by Iranian citizens fed up with regime’s corruption & its squandering of the nation’s wealth to fund terrorism abroad.  Iranian govt should respect their people’s rights, including right to express themselves.  The world is watching!  #IranProtests\. 

The Democrats have been told, and fully understand, that there can be no DACA without the desperately needed WALL at the Southern Border and an END to the horrible Chain Migration & ridiculous Lottery System of Immigration etc.  We must protect our Country at all cost! 

Why is the United States Post Office, which is losing many billions of dollars a year, while charging Amazon and others so little to deliver their packages, making Amazon richer and the Post Office dumber and poorer?  Should be charging MUCH MORE! 

While the Fake News loves to talk about my so-called low approval rating, @foxandfriends just showed that my rating on Dec.  28, 2017, was approximately the same as President Obama on Dec.  28, 2009, which was 47%... and this despite massive negative Trump coverage & Russia hoax! 

In the East, it could be the COLDEST New Year’s Eve on record.  Perhaps we could use a little bit of that good old Global Warming that our Country, but not other countries, was going to pay TRILLIONS OF DOLLARS to protect against.  Bundle up! 

Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

I've been saying it for a long, long time.  #NoKo. 

Caught RED HANDED - very disappointed that China is allowing oil to go into North Korea.  There will never be a friendly solution to the North Korea problem if this continues to happen! 

Retail sales are at record numbers.  We’ve got the economy going better than anyone ever dreamt - and you haven’t seen anything yet! 

Vanity Fair, which looks like it is on its last legs, is bending over backwards in apologizing for the minor hit they took at Crooked H.  Anna Wintour, who was all set to be Amb to Court of St James’s & a big fundraiser for CH, is beside herself in grief & begging for forgiveness! 

“Arrests of MS-13 Members, Associates Up 83% Under Trump”. 

“On 1/20 - the day Trump was inaugurated - an estimated 35,000 ISIS fighters held approx 17,500 square miles of territory in both Iraq and Syria.  As of 12/21, the U. S.  military est the remaining 1,000 or so fighters occupy roughly 1,900 square miles.. ” @jamiejmcintyre @dcexaminer. 

Just left West Palm Beach Fire & Rescue #2.  Met with great men and women as representatives of those who do so much for all of us.  Firefighters, paramedics, first responders - what amazing people they are! 

All signs are that business is looking really good for next year, only to be helped further by our Tax Cut Bill.  Will be a great year for Companies and JOBS!  Stock Market is poised for another year of SUCCESS! 

WOW, @foxandfrlends  “Dossier is bogus.  Clinton Campaign, DNC funded Dossier.  FBI CANNOT (after all of this time) VERIFY CLAIMS IN DOSSIER OF RUSSIA/TRUMP COLLUSION.  FBI TAINTED. ” And they used this Crooked Hillary pile of garbage as the basis for going after the Trump Campaign! 

Based on the fact that the very unfair and unpopular Individual Mandate has been terminated as part of our Tax Cut Bill, which essentially Repeals (over time) ObamaCare, the Democrats & Republicans will eventually come together and develop a great new HealthCare plan! 

I hope everyone is having a great Christmas, then tomorrow it’s back to work in order to Make America Great Again (which is happening faster than anyone anticipated)! 

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!. 

MERRY CHRISTMAS!!. 

People are proud to be saying Merry Christmas again.  I am proud to have led the charge against the assault of our cherished and beautiful phrase.  MERRY CHRISTMAS!!!!! 

The Tax Cut/Reform Bill, including Massive Alaska Drilling and the Repeal of the highly unpopular Individual Mandate, brought it all together as to what an incredible year we had.  Don’t let the Fake News convince you otherwise... and our insider Polls are strong! 

The Fake News refuses to talk about how Big and how Strong our BASE is.  They show Fake Polls just like they report Fake News.  Despite only negative reporting, we are doing well - nobody is going to beat us.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

. @FoxNews-FBI’s Andrew McCabe, “in addition to his wife getting all of this money from M (Clinton Puppet), he was using, allegedly, his FBI Official Email Account to promote her campaign.  You obviously cannot do this.  These were the people who were investigating Hillary Clinton. ”

Remember, the Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional races this year.  In Senate, I said Roy M would lose in Alabama and supported Big Luther Strange - and Roy lost.  Virginia candidate was not a “Trumper,” and he lost.   Good Republican candidates will win BIG! 

The Stock Market is setting record after record and unemployment is at a 17 year low.  So many things accomplished by the Trump Administration, perhaps more than any other President in first year.  Sadly, will never be reported correctly by the Fake News Media! 

Wow, “FBI lawyer James Baker reassigned,” according to @FoxNews. 

FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe is racing the clock to retire with full benefits.  90 days to go?!!! 

How can FBI Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, the man in charge, along with leakin’ James Comey, of the Phony Hillary Clinton investigation (including her 33,000 illegally deleted emails) be given $700,000 for wife’s campaign by Clinton Puppets during investigation? 

Remember, the most hated part of ObamaCare is the Individual Mandate, which is being terminated under our just signed Tax Cut Bill. 

Today, it was my great honor to sign the largest TAX CUTS and reform in the history of our country.  Full remarks. 

The United Nations Security Council just voted 15-0 in favor of additional Sanctions on North Korea.  The World wants Peace, not Death! 

Congressman Ron DeSantis is a brilliant young leader, Yale and then Harvard Law, who would make a GREAT Governor of Florida.  He loves our Country and is a true FIGHTER! 

95% of Americans will pay less or, at worst, the same amount of taxes (mostly far less).  The Dems only want to raise your taxes! 

Will be signing the biggest ever Tax Cut and Reform Bill in 30 minutes in Oval Office.  Will also be signing a much needed 4 billion dollar missile defense bill. 

With all my Administration has done on Legislative Approvals (broke Harry Truman’s Record), Regulation Cutting, Judicial Appointments, Building Military, VA, TAX CUTS & REFORM, Record Economy/Stock Market and so much more, I am sure great credit will be given by mainstream news? 

“The President has accomplished some absolutely historic things during this past year. ” Thank you Charlie Kirk of Turning Points USA.  Sadly, the Fake Mainstream Media will NEVER talk about our accomplishments in their end of year reviews.  We are compiling a long & beautiful list. 

At some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion.  Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start.  After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country! 

So true!. 

Our big and very popular Tax Cut and Reform Bill has taken on an unexpected new source of “love” - that is big companies and corporations showering their workers with bonuses.  This is a phenomenon that nobody even thought of, and now it is the rage.  Merry Christmas! 

THANK YOU to everyone who joined me at the @WhiteHouse yesterday.  Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

House Democrats want a SHUTDOWN for the holidays in order to distract from the very popular, just passed, Tax Cuts.  House Republicans, don’t let this happen.  Pass the C. R.  TODAY and keep our Government OPEN! 

Home Sales hit BEST numbers in 10 years!  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN\. 

Was @foxandfriends just named the most influential show in news?  You deserve it - three great people!  The many Fake News Hate Shows should study your formula for success! 

The Massive Tax Cuts, which the Fake News Media is desperate to write badly about so as to please their Democrat bosses, will soon be kicking in and will speak for themselves.  Companies are already making big payments to workers.  Dems want to raise taxes, hate these big Cuts! 

WE ARE MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

We are delivering HISTORIC TAX RELIEF for the American people! #TaxCutsandJobsAct. 

Together, we are MAKING AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

I would like to congratulate @SenateMajLdr on having done a fantastic job both strategically & politically on the passing in the Senate of the MASSIVE TAX CUT & Reform Bill.  I could have not asked for a better or more talented partner.  Our team will go onto many more VICTORIES! 

The Tax Cuts are so large and so meaningful, and yet the Fake News is working overtime to follow the lead of their friends, the defeated Dems, and only demean.  This is truly a case where the results will speak for themselves, starting very soon.  Jobs, Jobs, Jobs! 

The United States Senate just passed the biggest in history Tax Cut and Reform Bill.  Terrible Individual Mandate (ObamaCare)Repealed.  Goes to the House tomorrow morning for final vote.  If approved, there will be a News Conference at The White House at approximately 1:00 P. M. 

Congratulations to Paul Ryan, Kevin McCarthy, Kevin Brady, Steve Scalise, Cathy McMorris Rodgers and all great House Republicans who voted in favor of cutting your taxes! 

A  story in the @washingtonpost that I was close to “rescinding” the nomination of Justice Gorsuch prior to confirmation is FAKE NEWS.  I never even wavered and am very proud of him and the job he is doing as a Justice of the U. S.  Supreme Court.  The unnamed sources don’t exist! 

Stocks and the economy have a long way to go after the Tax Cut Bill is totally understood and appreciated in scope and size.  Immediate expensing will have a big impact.  Biggest Tax Cuts and Reform EVER passed.  Enjoy, and create many beautiful JOBS! 

DOW RISES 5000 POINTS ON THE YEAR FOR THE FIRST TIME EVER - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 

Together, our task is to strengthen our families, to build up our communities, to serve our citizens, and to celebrate AMERICAN GREATNESS as a shining example to the world..... 

With the strategy that I announced today, we are declaring that AMERICA is in the game and AMERICA is DETERMINED to WIN! OUR FOUR PILLARS OF NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY. 

70 Record Closes for the Dow so far this year!  We have NEVER had 70 Dow Records in a one year period.  Wow! 

Thank you Maria B!. 

So true Ivanka!. 

As the world watches, we are days away from passing HISTORIC TAX CUTS for American families and businesses.  It will be the BIGGEST TAX CUT and TAX REFORM in the HISTORY of our country!. 

When the American People speak, ALL OF US should listen.  Just over one year ago, you spoke loud and clear.  On November 8, 2016, you voted to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Over the past 11 months, I have travelled tens of thousands of miles, to visit 13 countries.  I have met with more than 100 world leaders and everywhere I traveled, it was my highest privilege and greatest honor to represent the AMERICAN PEOPLE!. 

Our deepest sympathies and most heartfelt prayers are with the victims of the train derailment in Washington State.  We are closely monitoring the situation and coordinating with local authorities.... 

My thoughts and prayers are with everyone involved in the train accident in DuPont, Washington.  Thank you to all of our wonderful First Responders who are on the scene.  We are currently monitoring here at the White House. 

The train accident that just occurred in DuPont, WA shows more than ever why our soon to be submitted infrastructure plan must be approved quickly.  Seven trillion dollars spent in the Middle East while our roads, bridges, tunnels, railways (and more) crumble!  Not for long! 

Ivanka Trump will be interviewed on @foxandfriends. 

Remember, Republicans are 5-0 in Congressional Races this year.  The media refuses to mention this.  I said Gillespie and Moore would lose (for very different reasons), and they did.  I also predicted  “I” would win.  Republicans will do well in 2018, very well!  @foxandfriends\. 

More than a century after conquering flight, the #WrightBrothers continue to motivate & inspire Americans, who never tire of exploration & innovation.  This GREAT AMERICAN SPIRIT can be found in the design of every new supersonic jet and next generation. 

Wonderful weekend at Camp David.  A very special place.  A lot of very important work done.  Heading back to the @WhiteHouse now.. 

As a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive TAX CUT for the everyday working American families who are the backbone and the heartbeat of our country.  Now, we are just days away.... 

WEEKLY ADDRESS<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

TAX CUTS will increase investment in the American economy and in U. S.  workers, leading to higher growth, higher wages, and more JOBS!. 

Congratulations to two great and hardworking guys, Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie, on the success of their just out book, “Let Trump Be Trump. ” Finally people with real knowledge are writing about our wonderful and exciting campaign! 

Great job Kevin, we are all proud of you!. 

DOW, S&P 500 and NASDAQ close at record highs!  #MAGA. 

Today, it was my tremendous honor to visit Marine Helicopter Squadron One (HMX-1) at the Marine Corps Air Facility in Quantico, Virginia.  I am honored to serve as your Commander-in-Chief.  On behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service.  We love you!. 

You are always there for us – THE MEN AND WOMEN IN BLUE. Thank you to our police, thank you to our sheriffs, and thank you to our law enforcement families.  God Bless you all, and GOD BLESS AMERICA!  #LESM. 

To each member of the graduating class from the National Academy at Quantico, CONGRATULATIONS!. 

It was my honor.  THANK YOU!. 

“Manufacturing Optimism Rose to Another All-Time High in the Latest @ShopFloorNAM Outlook Survey”. 

In 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations.  Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room. Today, we CUT THE RED TAPE!  It is time to SET FREE OUR DREAMS and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

When Americans are free to thrive, innovate, & prosper, there is no challenge too great, no task too large, & no goal beyond our reach.  We are a nation of explorers, pioneers, innovators & inventors.  We are nation of people who work hard, dream big, & who never, ever give up.... 

Today, we gathered in the Roosevelt Room for one single reason: to CUT THE RED TAPE!  For many decades, an ever-growing maze of regs, rules, and restrictions has cost our country trillions of dollars, millions of jobs, countless American factories, & devastated entire industries.. 

As a candidate, I promised we would pass a massive tax cut for the everyday, working Americans.  If you make your voices heard, this moment will be forever remembered as a great new beginning – the dawn of a brilliant American future shining with PATRIOTISM, PROSPERITY AND PRIDE!. 

Republican Tax Cuts are looking very good.  All are working hard.  In the meantime, the Stock Market hit another record high! 

Thank you Omarosa for your service!  I wish you continued success. 

If last night’s election proved anything, it proved that we need to put up GREAT Republican candidates to increase the razor thin margins in both the House and Senate. 

Wow, more than 90% of Fake News Media coverage of me is negative, with numerous forced retractions of untrue stories.  Hence my use of Social Media, the only way to get the truth out.  Much of Mainstream Meadia has become a joke!  @foxandfriends\. 

The reason I originally endorsed Luther Strange (and his numbers went up mightily), is that I said Roy Moore will not be able to win the General Election.   I was right!  Roy worked hard but the deck was stacked against him! 

Congratulations to Doug Jones on a hard fought victory.  The write-in votes played a very big factor, but a win is a win.  The people of Alabama are great, and the Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.  It never ends! 

Wishing all of those celebrating #Hanukkah around the world a happy and healthy eight nights in the company of those they love.. 

Consumer Confidence is at an All-Time High, along with a Record High Stock Market.  Unemployment is at a 17 year low.  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  Working to pass MASSIVE TAX CUTS (looking good). 

The people of Alabama will do the right thing.  Doug Jones is Pro-Abortion, weak on Crime, Military and Illegal Immigration, Bad for Gun Owners and Veterans and against the WALL.  Jones is a Pelosi/Schumer Puppet.  Roy Moore will always vote with us.  VOTE ROY MOORE! 

Lightweight Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a total flunky for Chuck Schumer and someone who would come to my office “begging” for campaign contributions not so long ago (and would do anything for them), is now in the ring fighting against Trump.  Very disloyal to Bill & Crooked-USED! 

Despite thousands of hours wasted and many millions of dollars spent, the Democrats have been unable to show any collusion with Russia - so now they are moving on to the false accusations and fabricated stories of women who I don’t know and/or have never met.  FAKE NEWS! 

Another false story, this time in the Failing @nytimes, that I watch 4-8 hours of television a day - Wrong!   Also, I seldom, if ever, watch CNN or MSNBC, both of which I consider Fake News.  I never watch Don Lemon, who I once called the “dumbest man on television! ” Bad Reporting. 

Very little discussion of all the purposely false and defamatory stories put out this week by the Fake News Media.  They are out of control - correct reporting means nothing to them.  Major lies written, then forced to be withdrawn after they are exposed... a stain on America! 

Getting closer and closer on the Tax Cut Bill.  Shaping up even better than projected.  House and Senate working very hard and smart.  End result will be not only important, but SPECIAL! 

Things are going really well for our economy, a subject the Fake News spends as little time as possible discussing!  Stock Market hit another RECORD HIGH, unemployment is now at a 17 year low and companies are coming back into the USA.  Really good news, and much more to come! 

No American should be separated from their loved ones because of preventable crime committed by those illegally in our country.  Our cities should be Sanctuaries for Americans – not for criminal aliens!. 

Great Army - Navy Game.  Army wins 14 to 13 and brings home the COMMANDER-IN-CHIEF’S TROPHY!  Congratulations! 

. @daveweigel of the Washington Post just admitted that his picture was a FAKE (fraud? ) showing an almost empty arena last night for my speech in Pensacola when, in fact, he knew the arena was packed (as shown also on T. V. ).  FAKE NEWS, he should be fired. 

@washingtonpost @daveweigel . @DaveWeigel @WashingtonPost put out a phony photo of an empty arena hours before I arrived @ the venue, w/ thousands of people outside, on their way in.  Real photos now shown as I spoke.  Packed house, many people unable to get in.  Demand apology & retraction from FAKE NEWS WaPo!. 

Have a great game today, @USArmy and @USNavy - I will be watching.  We love our U. S.  Military.  On behalf of an entire Nation, THANK YOU for your sacrifice and service!  #ArmyNavyGame #USA<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

It was my great honor to celebrate the opening of two extraordinary museums-the Mississippi State History Museum & the Mississippi Civil Rights Museum.  We pay solemn tribute to our heroes of the past & dedicate ourselves to building a future of freedom, equality, justice & peace.. 

Heading to the great state of Mississippi at the invitation of their popular and respected Governor, @PhilBryantMS.  Look forward to seeing the new Civil Rights Museum! 

CNN’S slogan is CNN, THE MOST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS.  Everyone knows this is not true, that this could, in fact, be a fraud on the American Public.  There are many outlets that are far more trusted than Fake News CNN.  Their slogan should be CNN, THE LEAST TRUSTED NAME IN NEWS! 

Fake News CNN made a vicious and purposeful mistake yesterday.  They were caught red handed, just like lonely Brian Ross at ABC News (who should be immediately fired for his “mistake”).  Watch to see if @CNN fires those responsible, or was it just gross incompetence? 

A big contingent of very enthusiastic Roy Moore fans at the rally last night.  We can’t have a Pelosi/Schumer Liberal Democrat, Jones, in that important Alabama Senate seat.  Need your vote to Make America Great Again!  Jones will always vote against what we must do for our Country. 

GREAT EVENING last night in Pensacola, Florida.  Arena was packed to the rafters, the crowd was loud, loving and really smart.  They definitely get what’s going on.  Thank you Pensacola! 

We believe that every American should stand for the National Anthem, and we proudly pledge allegiance to one NATION UNDER GOD!. 

This is your land, this is your home, and it's your voice that matters the most.  So speak up, be heard, and fight, fight, fight for the change you've been waiting for your entire life! MERRY CHRISTMAS and THANK YOU Pensacola, Florida!. 

Just arrived at the Pensacola Bay Center.  Join me LIVE on @FoxNews in 10 minutes!  #MAGA. 

On my way to Pensacola, Florida.  See everyone soon!  #MAGA. 

“The unemployment rate remains at a 17-year low of 4. 1%.  The unemployment rate in manufacturing dropped to 2. 6%, the lowest ever recorded.  The unemployment rate among Hispanics dropped to 4. 7%, the lowest ever recorded... ”@SecretaryAcosta @USDOL. 

MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!. 

Fines and penalties against Wells Fargo Bank for their bad acts against their customers and others will not be dropped, as has incorrectly been reported, but will be pursued and, if anything, substantially increased.  I will cut Regs but make penalties severe when caught cheating! 

LAST thing the Make America Great Again Agenda needs is a Liberal Democrat in Senate where we have so little margin for victory already.  The Pelosi/Schumer Puppet Jones would vote against us 100% of the time.  He’s bad on Crime, Life, Border, Vets, Guns & Military.  VOTE ROY MOORE! 

Big crowd expected today in Pensacola, Florida, for a Make America Great Again speech.  We have done so much in so short a period of time... and yet are planning to do so much more!  See you there! 

I fulfilled my campaign promise - others didn’t!. 

Tonight, @FLOTUS Melania and I were thrilled to welcome so many wonderful friends to the @WhiteHouse – and wish them all a very #HappyHanukkah. 

Across the battlefields, oceans, and harrowing skies of Europe and the Pacific throughout the war, one great battle cry could be heard by America’s friends and foes alike:“REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR. ”. 

Today, as we Remember Pearl Harbor, it was an incredible honor to be joined with surviving Veterans of the attack on 12/7/1941.  They are HEROES, and they are living witnesses to American History.  All American hearts are filled with gratitude for their service and their sacrifice.. 

Today, the U. S.  flag flies at half-staff at the @WhiteHouse, in honor of National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day.. 

Today, our entire nation pauses to REMEMBER PEARL HARBOR—and the brave warriors who on that day stood tall and fought for America.  God Bless our HEROES who wear the uniform, and God Bless the United States of America.  #PearlHarborRemembranceDay<Emoji: Flag of United States>. 

National Pearl Harbor Remembrance Day - “A day that will live in infamy! ” December 7, 1941\. 

Go get the new book on Andrew Jackson by Brian Kilmeade... Really good.  @foxandfriends\.
