In the end, you're measured not by how much you undertake but by what you finally accomplish. 

Without passion you don't have energy, without energy you have nothing.  Find work that you love and the energy will be there. 

If you're interested in 'balancing' work and pleasure, stop trying to balance them.  Instead make your work more pleasurable.

Romney was the architect of ObamaCare.  Bush’s Chief Justice legalized the monstrosity.  Notice a trend?

A Clinton already defeated a Bush.  The definition of insanity is doing the same thing twice & expecting a different result. 

If only Obama would treat @IsraeliPM @netanyahu with the same respect he awards tyrants.  Very strange & dangerous for our national security. 

Obama now wants to deny due process to the police.  He’ll give all constitutional rights to the terrorists but not our cops.

President Obama has absolutely no control (or respect) over the African American community-they have fared so poorly under his presidency. 

If you love it, own it.  @TrumpCondosLV bring unparalleled style, elegance and world class amenities to Las Vegas. 

Who is the moron who decided to release the Ferguson grand jury findings after 9:00 o'clock in the evening.  What were they thinking? 

Our country is totally fractured and, with our weak leadership in Washington, you can expect Ferguson type riots and looting in other places\. 

Sadly, because president Obama has done such a poor job as president, you won't see another black president for generations! 

As China and the rest of the World continue to rip off the U. S.  economically, they laugh at us and our president over the riots in Ferguson! 

Can you imagine what Putin and all of our friends and enemies throughout the world are saying about the U. S.  as they watch the Ferguson riot\. 

If the decision by the grand jury in Ferguson was the exact opposite, you would still be having the riots right now! 

Despite having a black president, the racial divide seems greater than it has in decades. If Obama were a  leader, this would not be the case\. 

"@TheRealZach49: This is why we need @realDonaldTrump in office.  @BarackObama doesn't know how to keep order"

"@Abdul_Akbarzai1:  "@TheRealZach49: @realDonaldTrump can't wait for you to take over this country and rebuild what Obama destroyed"

@d_mellette "@D_Mellette: @realDonaldTrump for president 2k16"

Why would they announce a finding of the grand jury in Ferguson at 9:00 in the evening - a prime time for riots!  Not smart. 

Iran and the United States just pushed deadline back SEVEN MONTHS on working out a nuclear deal.  Iran is tapping along our bad negotiators! 

ISIS is starting its own currency.  May be stronger than the dollar if ObamaCare is fully implemented. 

There is no excuse for riots in Ferguson regardless of the grand jury outcome. 

Fact – Amnesty lowers wages and invites more lawlessness.  Obama has unilaterally cancelled any chance of immigration reform.

I have been saying for weeks for President Obama to stop the flights from West Africa.  So simple, but he refused.  A TOTAL incompetent! 

Ebola has been confirmed in N. Y. C. , with officials frantically trying to find all of the people and things he had contact with. Obama's fault\. 

If this doctor, who so recklessly flew into New York from West Africa,has Ebola,then Obama should apologize to the American people & resign! 

There is a good possibility that a person who treated patients in West Africa and who FLEW into New York has Ebola.  Touched many, bedlam!

The only reason I am critical of the Pinehurst look is because I’m a lover of golf—and that look on TV hurts golf badly.

@MattGinellaGC  I have watched Open Championships at Turnberry, one of the great golf courses of the World.  Pinehurst not in the same league\. 

@MattGinellaGC  My position on Pinehurst is correct - bad for the game, a dried out cow pasture.  You have no clue but keep trying!

I have been very consistent and always said that Iraq would fall as soon as the U. S.  left.  What a terrible waste of lives and money! 

Iran will convince our incompetent President that they are trying to help us with Iraq, take over the country & oil, and "O" will say thanks\. 

Turnberry in Scotland is a far superior golf course to Pinehurst - and it isn't even close!  Likewise the Blue Monster at Doral. 

Iran is moving troops into Iraq under the guise that it is helping out.  Actually, they will take over Iraq and all of their oil.  Stupid U. S.

Because of our terrible leaders, it is now open season on every American throughout the world.  Terrorists are thrilled.

I will be ON THE RECORD with Greta Van Susteren @gretawire tonight at 7 pm eastern/FOX News Channel\. 

"If you're going through hell, keep going. " -- Winston Churchill\. 

"Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts. " -- Winston Churchill\. 

"You have enemies?  Good.  That means you've stood up for something, sometime in your life. " --  Winston Churchill\. 

Some great quotes from the legendary and courageous Winston Churchill: "Never, never, never give up. " ... 

If you’ve looked over the years,I’ve been right on virtually every issue from Iraq (not going in but if so taking the oil) to jobs to China\. 

By Obama mentioning Manhattan yesterday in his response, he has singlehandedly made it target #1.  How totally stupid is this guy? 

"@wesbart53: Watched his speech yesterday... pathetic.  Carter-esque, weak.  His delivery is so cautious not to offend, absolutely zero"  True! 

This is the time for the United States to be strengthening all important military components - not rolling over and dealing from weakness! 

Not good or smart for Obama to be calling Russia a "regional" power or to mention the concept of a nuclear weapon going off in NYC. 

President Obama looks absolutely exhausted in the Netherlands.  He is not a natural leader, was never ment to lead - it is tough work for him\. 

"He that is good for making excuses is seldom good for anything else. " -- Benjamin Franklin\. 

Robert Slater, who just passed away, was a terrific writer who wrote a very fair book about me.  He will be missed..

Thank you to @GaryVanSickle & Sports Illustrated @SInow  for the really nice piece about me.  March 17, 2014 issue. 

Obama should stop running down the stairs when getting off Air Force One.   Doesn’t look presidential and at some point he will take a fall. 

I wonder if Apple is upset with me for hounding them to produce a large screen iPhone.  I hear they will be doing it soon—long overdue. 

Obama must now FOCUS, get his mind off "March. Madness", and LEAD!  Watch Russia closely, work hard on the economy and get rid of ObamaCare! 

The situation with Russia is much more dangerous than most people may think - and could lead to World War III.  WE NEED GREAT LEADERSHIP FAST\. 

We should be building up our military and our missile defense systems to their highest levels ever.  Must be very strong to prosper & survive\. 

I believe Putin will continue to re-build the Russian Empire.  He has zero respect for Obama or the U. S.! 

Putin has become a big hero in Russia with an all time high popularity.  Obama, on the other hand, has fallen to his lowest ever numbers.  SAD\. 

Great advice from my mother: “Trust in God and be true to yourself. ” – Mary MacLeod Trump\. 

Great advice from my father: "Know everything you can about what you're doing. " -- Fred C.  Trump\. 

"Continuous effort - not strength or intelligence - is the key to unlocking our potential. "  -- Winston Churchill\. 

President Obama, be cool, be smart, be sharp and FOCUS (no more March Madness), and you can beat Putin at his own game.  IT CAN BE DONE! 

While Putin is scheming and beaming on how to take over the World, President Obama is watching March Madness (basketball)! 

I don't hate Obama at all, I just think he is an absolutely terrible president, maybe the worst in our history! 

We're spending a fortune looking for the lost plane with mostly Chinese passengers, and that's OK-but how much are Russia & China spending? 

President Obama was able to fool the Americans by getting elected, but not able to fool Vladimir Putin.  Too bad for us! 

"Failure is simply the opportunity to begin again, this time more intelligently. " -- Henry Ford\.

"@CheezitsCat: . @realDonaldTrump what is ur favorite plane? "  Boeing 757 and Citation X. 

Looks like plane may have been found in the Indian Ocean off the coast of Australia. 

Lithium ion batteries should  not be allowed to be used in aircraft.  I won't fly on the Boeing 787 Dreamliner - it uses those batteries. 

Plane was carrying those terrible lithium ion batteries, which are highly combustible, as cargo.  Fire could have started in cockpit.

Why didn’t Gates resign if he was so unhappy about what he was being told by Obama?  The fact is, Iraq etc.  have always been disasters!

Please, @21Club, go back to your original menu and preparation.  Believe me, it was much better.  Let me know when the change is made! 

Identify your goals.  Know precisely what you want to achieve, study the best people in your field,and then plan the best route for success.

The con artists changed the name from GLOBAL WARMING to CLIMATE CHANGE when GLOBAL WARMING was no longer working and credibility was lost! 

What the hell is going on with GLOBAL WARMING.  The planet is freezing, the ice is building and the G. W.  scientists are stuck-a total con job\.

Cover your bases--know everything you can about what you're doing.  Keep your focus by being well informed on a daily basis. 

Ask yourself, "Is this a blip or is it a catastrophe? " and your equilibrium will be kept in check if/when hard times hit. 

Be tough, be focused.  There are a lot of ups and downs, but you can ride them out if you're prepared for them.

We're coming up on the NEW YEAR-It is really important that, despite so many stupid decisions being made in Washington, we make it BEST EVER\. 

The global warming  scientists don't want to be airlifted off the ship-they are having too much fun and that is too simple a solution-FAME! 

We should be focused on clean and beautiful air-not expensive and business closing GLOBAL WARMING-a total hoax!

ALWAYS TRY TO LEARN FROM OTHER PEOPLES MISTAKES, NOT YOUR OWN - IT IS MUCH CHEAPER THAT WAY! 

SOMETIMES YOUR BEST INVESTMENTS ARE THE ONES YOU DON'T MAKE! 

Did you ever not do something that had you done it would have turned out to be a disaster.  Never look back, just learn from your experience! 

Realize that being an entrepreneur is not a group effort.  You're in charge--everything starts with you. 

Entrepreneurs: Be ready for problems--you'll have them every day.  Keep open to new ideas--that's where innovation begins. 

@TSeay18 Find work that you love--you have to be passionate about it to succeed.  Then focus and never give up!

Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen got delayed by at least two years. @AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay! 

The talk in Albany is that JCOPE & Moreland Commissions are taking my complaint against lightweight (cont). 

@agschneiderman Sources inside @AGSchneiderman’s office are saying that they are very concerned with the allegations against their lightweight boss. 

@agschneiderman My complaint against @AGSchneiderman is a “case study” for JCOPE & Moreland Commissions on everything that is wrong with NYS politics.

@agschneiderman Illegal use of official Attorney General stationary by lightweight @AGSchneiderman.. 

Via @worldnetdaily by @MichaelCarl7: “Trump: Obama blew chance to free U. S.  pastor”. 

Iran must immediately allow Christian #PastorSaeed out of prison or we should put back sanctions (which should never have been lifted)

Naghmeh Abedini, the lovely wife of the Christian Pastor Saeed being held in an Iranian jail, just left my office.  #savesaeed\. 

@agschneiderman State Senator Shirley Huntley "ratted" on black politicians & was believed--when she ratted on @AGSchneiderman, nobody listened.  Racism! 

Major League Baseball: The best thing you can do is let @PeteRose_14---your all time hits leader---into the Hall of Fame.  It's time! 

"@koos32@realDonaldTrump Donald, you also belong in the same category as a great leader.  The US needs you! " Thanks. 

"@warrencasselljr                      Watching The Apprentice UK.  Not as good as @realDonaldTrump's Apprentice. " True! 

"@adamricheal                       DonaldTrump for Pres 2016 America's economy needs his business Midas Touch & no nonsense approach" Thx. 

If Graydon Carter's very dumb bosses would fire him for his terrible circulation numbers at failing Vanity Fair-his bad food restaurants die\. 

The ill-conceived windfarm that @AlexSalmond is pushing for Aberdeen will lose $50 million a year.  Only a fool would build it or want it! 

Bird killing windfarm that I oppose in Aberdeen just got delayed by at least two years. @AlexSalmond forced the failing developers to delay! 

"@DennyHuntington                     @foxandfriends I look forward to you on Mondays!  Always insightful conversations" Thanks\. 

@agschneiderman ICYMI via @AmSpec by Jeffrey Lord: “THE MALVERSATION OF @AGSchneiderman - Trump hits NY AG with ethics charge. ”. 

WH claims it lied about Pres.  Obama living with his uncle b/c “wasn’t mentioned in his book. ” I guess Bill Ayers never knew about it! 

Where’s the leadership?  Obama only met with Sebelius ONCE since ObamaCare passed     His signature legislation... 

Graydon Carter, whose reign over failing @VanityFair has been a disaster, has acted in two movies--both bombed & got bad reviews. 

@baseballhall It’s time for @PeteRose_14 to enter @MLB’s @BaseballHall.  All time hits leader has paid the price. 

@baseballhall Congrats to @JoeTorre, @TonyLaRussa & Bobby Cox on all being unanimously elected to @MLB’s @BaseballHall!  Great leaders & managers. 

As always & due to popular demand,@TrumpRink will be open  Christmas eve & day as well as New Year's eve & day. 

"@wakafee1017@realDonaldTrump Everyone should look at what he has done & take notes if you want to be successful. " Thx\.

"@discretepi4you@foxandfriends I look forward to your segment every week.  Clear, concise and common sense! " Thanks. 

"@foolishvessel                      - was so awesome u hosted @NaghmehAbedini this week!  Please give it ur utmost to #FreeSaeed! " I will! 

@piersmorgan Just read @PiersMorgan’s book “Shooting Straight” and whether you love him or hate him (I’m in the first category), it is terrific. 

Just left Florida, amazing how well State is doing-- jobs way up, taxes down.  Congrats to @FLGovScott\. 

Dopey Graydon Carter, who is presiding over dying @VanityFair magazine, is also presiding over dying Waverly Inn—worst food in city. 

I really enjoy doing @foxandfriends every Monday at 7 AM.   @sdoocy, @ehasselbeck and @kilmeade are great people. 

The Unaffordable Care Act, sometimes referred to as ObamaCare, is not working.  Millions of people are losing their plans and doctors-fraud! 

Obama said he never met his uncle, Oscar, who was arrested for whatever.  Turns out he lived with his uncle in Boston.  SO MANY LIES! 

"@CONKJR:   did you tour @TrumpGolfLA.  One of the best golf courses in the world with one of the best supers in Martin Howard" Thank you! 

@VanityFair   Wow, I just looked at the circulation numbers - Vanity Fair Magazine won't be around much longer, it's really in bad shape! 

Just got back to New York from California.  Will be on Fox  & Friends tomorrow morning at 7. 00.  ObamaCare and other disasters to be discussed\. 

P. S.  - There is also something really good to say about humility.  Being confident and humble is a great combination, maybe the best of all! 

People are always asking me about the very special word, CONFIDENCE.  The fact is there is (almost) nothing like it.  Is derived from winning! 

Show me someone without an ego, and I'll show you a loser - having a healthy ego, or high opinion of yourself, is a real positive in life! 

@LoisPope1   Word is that the dinner tonight at Mar-a-Lago, hosted by the incomparable Lois Pope, was fabulous.  Big money raised for charity\. 

"@HMunjal:  You're one of the most educated, handsome and sophisticated men that I know of.  Men should aspire to be like you. "  Thank you! 

In making big money, knowledge is far more important than any other ingredient, including money itself! 

My father Fred Trump left me a relatively small amount of money (compared to where I am today-over $10 billion) but vast amount of knowledge\.

"@TimLeman: @realDonaldTrump What was one thing others underestimated about you? "  That I never give up! 

"@_TrevorJames: I'd work for @realDonaldTrump for free"  I love that!
