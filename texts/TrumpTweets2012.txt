Republicans have all the cards... but they just don't know it! 

Republicans are making a mistake if they don't solve the fiscal problem now... only the big deal should be approved!

Any deal completed before the fiscal curb must have tangible cuts on expenditures, in baseline spending, so we can get our credit back. 

The Republicans once again hold all the cards with the debt ceiling.   They can get everything they want.   Focus!

Busy day—working on buying a major property—and creating lots of jobs. 

Social media has changed the news & communication landscape for good.  Everything must be up to date by the second instead of the hour or day\. 

A former classmate, Roy Eaton, has published a great book, “Makers, Shakers & Takers” – check it out. 

Obama’s own top donor is now laying employees off and lowering hours in anticipation of Obama Care    The new reality.

General Petreus and his family are paying a big price! 

. @cher should spend more time focusing on her family and dying career! 

Paula Broadwell's book on Gen.  Petreus is titled "All In. " Did she know something?

Scary – in the past 90 days, Obama has set over 6,125 regulatory burdens   Terrible for the economy. 

This past October, China’s export surplus grew to 5 month high of 11%, biggest jump in 45 months   Not good. 

Gen.  David Petraeus should testify this week on Benghazi.   He shouldn’t be allowed to hide behind his resignation--wife really angry!

@BOARDRISKMAN  Thanks! 

Tourism is booming because of it.  RT @DuncanBannatyne Just been to the fantastic @realDonaldTrump golf links in Aberdeen.  Quality stuff\. 

According to UK newspapers, no wind turbines have been ordered for many months in Britain--an obsolete technology that ruins communities! 

When someone attacks me, I always attack back... except 100x more.  This has nothing to do with a tirade but rather, a way of life! 

I am a very calm person but love tweeting about both scum and positive subjects.  Whenever I tweet, some call it a tirade.. totally dishonest! 

Trump International Golf Links was just rated one of the greatest courses in the world.  Virtually all reviews are saying the same thing.  

The people of Scotland love Trump International Golf Links. 

Aberdeen tourism is booming because of my great Scottish golf club.

I'm a skeptical guy, but I don't believe Petraeus used this to get out of the Benghazi hearings. 

Wow,  I never saw the Petraeus thing coming.  A straight laced guy!  Very sad for him and his family. 

I just passed a 10 block long gas line going to LGA airport, a terrible situation!

. @antbaxter—Heard your documentary cost you less than $3,000 to make—where did you get that kind of money? 

. @antbaxter—Your documentary works better than any sleeping pill—in fact that may be your only way to make money with this recycled garbage! 

Why do so many people say I hate President Obama—I don’t hate the President at all.  I just disagree with his policies! 

@antbaxter @Salon @antbaxter—Apprentice is a huge hit all over the world.  Your cheap & boring documentary is a tremendous flop. 

9 million fewer people voted for Obama this election than last & yet the Republicans lost—do you think they might be doing something wrong! 

I got to know @johnboehner very well—he is a great guy who will do the right thing for the country! 

I received such a nice letter today from someone who took refuge in Trump Tower during Sandy.  It was my pleasure to help. 

Robert Pattinson is putting on a good face for the release of Twilight.  He took my advice on Kristen Stewart... I hope! 

The election was a major setback for economy.  All young entrepreneurs should be sure to calculate Obama's policies into their investments. 

Of the 9 battleground states, we only carried North Carolina.  I'm proud of @NCGOP & glad I delivered keynote at their state convention. 

@HISTORY Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History\. 

Polls show that the hurricane had a huge positive effect for Obama on his win- isn't that ridiculous? 

Romney campaign used me in 6 primary states and won every one- they should have used me in Florida and Ohio & he would be President. 

@HISTORY Remember to watch the series finale of "The Men Who Built America" this Sunday at 8/7c on @History\. 

China is heavily investing in building its own jet engine    They will end up stealing the design from us as usual. 

China's submarines will soon be carrying nukes    They will be sent to patrol our coasts, Obama won't do anything. 

China's Communist Party has now publicly praised Obama's reelection.   They have never had it so good.   Will own America soon. 

At the end of the day, Obama won the battleground states by less than 500,000 votes.  This was a winnable race.   GOP needs to do better! 

With taxes set to go up and Obama about to cut the mortgage deduction, now is the time to buy a house if you can.   Can get a great deal. 

. @davidaxelrod I'm sending you a check to help find a cure.  @IvankaTrump says hi. 

No surprise that all the foreign countries are celebrating Obama's win.   They love a weak America that they can rip off. 

Obama's administration is now openly admitting it expects US credit downgraded again   Thanks for letting us know now\. 

@realDonaldTrump I will and I agree!  RT @ZacharyQuinto@realdonaldtrump you can't possibly make any more money.  so why don't you make a difference instead?! 

I started to get very worried about Mitt's chances when I heard that A-Rod donated to his campaign.  Everything A-Rod touches turns bad. 

Russian leaders are publicly celebrating Obama's reelection.   They can't wait to see how flexible Obama will be now. 

It is that time of the year.   The Trump Wollman Skating Rink is open to the public in Central Park.   The greatest ice rink in the country. 

Letterman @Late_Show had Brian Williams @NBCNightlyNews as guest last night, I was on last Thursday\. 

... I  trounced him in ratings & Letterman beat @jayleno last Thursday.  Brian—are you irrelevant? 

Tweet me back if u think we should start a petition to fire @hardball_chris for his  comments on Sandy & the death & destruction it caused. 

A test: tweet me the reason @billmaher was fired from @ABC (other than his bad ratings). 

. @hardball_chris says he’s “glad” we had a hurricane!  With many people dying and thousands hurting, MSNBC (cont).

It has been a pleasure to make so many friends and meet so many great people on the trail this past cycle.   We will fight on! 

Beijing had a bigger celebration than Chicago last night.   The Chinese are happier with the election than we are. 

The stock market and US dollar are both plunging today.   Welcome to @BarackObama’s second term. 

Congrats to @KarlRove on blowing $400 million this cycle.  Every race @CrossroadsGPS ran ads in, the Republicans lost.  What a waste of money. 

Millions without electricity across NY & NJ.  The media has covered for Obama’s massive failure.  Can you imagine if this was another Pres? 

@repweiner Pervert alert.   @RepWeiner is back on twitter.  All girls under the age of 18, block him immediately. 

Amazing, various celebrities were far harsher than me with political statements--- but media doesn't care about.... 

It's freezing and snowing in New York--we need global warming! 

We have to make America great again! 

Our country is totally split right now but someday it will come together! 

Another four years--not good for the country but we'll have to live with it! 

This was the Republicans election to win but they just blew it--reasons why to follow. 

Brian, if I'm "well past the last exit to relevance" how come you spent so much time reading my tweets last night?  @NBCNightlyNews\. 

Brian Williams was never a smart guy but always passes himself off as such.  People will learn the truth!  @NBCNightlyNews\. 

Brian, I hope @NBCNightlyNews isn't paying you too much--look at what's happening to nightly news. 

Brian--Thanks dummy--I picked up 70,000 twitter followers yesterday alone.  Cable News just passed you in the ratings.  @NBCNightlyNews\. 

The voting booth process was a total disaster—it could and should be much better and more efficient—tremendous room for error! 

This was the Republicans election to win.  @MittRomney is a good man but he just never connected with the people. 

@BWilliams . @bwilliams--wouldn't you love to have my ratings? 

@BWilliams The only thing more boring than @bwilliams newscast is his show Rock Center which is totally dying in the ratings—a disaster! 

@BWilliams . @bwilliams knows that I think his newscast has become totally boring so he took a shot at me last night. 

Trump volunteers were out early today to offload cases of food and supplies for hard-hit Rockaways residents #Sandy\. 

I’ve sent a 10-wheeler filled with 358 master cases of food and supplies to my hometown of Queens today #TrumpCares\. 

P. S.  42 in Queens is getting a truckload of food and much needed supplies for Rockaway residents #HurricaneSandyRelief\. 

House of Representatives shouldn't give anything to Obama unless he terminates Obamacare. 

Hopefully the House of Representatives can hold our country together for four more years... stay strong and never give up! 

The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. 

Our nation is a once great nation divided! 

Our country is now in serious and unprecedented  trouble... like never before. 

This election is a total sham and a travesty.  We are not a democracy! 

Lets fight like hell and stop this great and disgusting injustice!  The world is laughing at us. 

We can't let this happen.  We should march on Washington and stop this travesty.  Our nation is totally divided! 

Well, back to the drawing board!

I love show "Law and Order" but the @MRbelzer casting is the worst ever.  No talent--unwatchable! 

I have had the pleasure of getting to know @AnnDRomney & @MittRomney this past year.  They love America.  Let's push them over the top today. 

Do we still want a President who bows to the Saudis and lets OPEC rip us off?  Make America strong, vote for @MittRomney.

@Tappersong  Thanks Gary. 

Obama thinks he can just laugh off the fact that he refuses to release his records to the American public.  He can't. 

Watch Obama refuse to call Benghazi a terrorist attack on 9. 12   What took @CBS so long to release this footage? 

If you experience any harassment or heckling at the polling places from Obama supporters, make sure you report it immediately. 

Now Chinese state run companies are taking over our coal market    China wants to deplete our resources here at home. 

Yesterday Obama campaigned with JayZ & Springsteen while Hurricane Sandy victims across NY & NJ are still decimated by Sandy.   Wrong! 

Make sure to verify the voting machine does not switch your vote.  If you have any problems, notify the poll workers. 

More reports of voting machines switching Romney votes to Obama.  Pay close attention to the machines, don't let your vote be stolen\.

My radio interview with @GovMikeHuckabee where I discuss Obama hiding from my $5M charitable offer, Benghazi & Sandy. 

@JoeBiden’s unannounced visit to Cleveland shows Ohio is trending for @MittRomney.   Come on Tea Party – I know you can deliver it today! 

Very dangerous pattern developing across country by Obama supporters.   Detroit poll watcher was threatened with gun. 

Make sure to vote today.   Vote for real change.   Change that will deliver jobs and a free & strong America.   Vote for @MittRomney. 

The New Black Panthers are back at the same Philly polling station from '08    Don't let them intimidate you!

Me voting--- it really is my hair!. 

@NGen52  I never went bankrupt. 

@jtylerdowling   Thanks\. 

@SpencerLJackson  Yes! 

Remember: Obama turned down $5M to charity which I said I would increase by 10X to $50M--just to show simple records.  He's hiding lots!

Despite the upcoming election, the cover of paper-thin Time Magazine looks like an ad for the movie Lincoln--sad! 

Before you vote, think: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more! 

Why is Obama playing basketball today?  That is why our country is in trouble! 

I was invited to be with Mitt Romney tonight --- win, lose, or draw, I’ll be there! 

Answer to your questions- I will be voting at 10:30 AM at Lighthouse International 110 East 60th Street, Manhattan\. 

Go out and vote--- this will be the most important election of our time! 

Tune in for #TrumpTuesday on @SquawkCNBC tomorrow morning. 

Benghazi is bigger than Watergate.   Don’t let Obama get away with allowing Americans to die.   Kick him out of office tomorrow. 

The outer boroughs of Manhattan are still devasted by Sandy.  How would the press cover this if a Republican was President. 

China is worried.  The polls are trending for @MittRomney.  They won’t be able to steal from us anymore. 

@ABFalecbaldwin . @ABFAlecBaldwin  P. S.  Your brother @StephenBaldwin7 is doing very well on @ApprenticeNBC--and he stated he "adores you. "

@ABFalecbaldwin . @ABFAlecBaldwin  They were rising in the 1950's then went back down--they will go up and down through eternity. 

Voting for @GovGaryJohnson is voting for Obama--don't waste your vote! 

Tomorrow’s election will have historic repercussions for our country.   Make America strong again.   Vote for @MittRomney. 

@mcuban ---- Do you mean the President's birthplace? 

. @mcuban Letterman @Late_Show had his best ratings with me--and you bombed.  People don't care about Mark Cuban. 

After 13 seasons, @ApprenticeNBC easily beat Shark Tank in ratings last year-- better demos as well. 

. @mcuban, Shark Tank was shoved to Friday evening-- Friday is considered “dead television. ” Besides, you are not the star (& never will be). 

Obama just stated "It's always good to ignore Donald Trump. " I state he is right, especially when the truth is against him. 

. @mcuban Your team owners are tired of losing so much money with the @dallasmavs.  I love the fact that they are (cont).

@TODAYshow Like Al Sharpton, @DonnyDeutsch apologized to me for calling me a racist on @todayshow--apology accepted! 

Don't believe Chrysler (if Obama wins)--see how fast @Jeep production will be moved to China--and I'll be watching! 

. @mcuban When Apprentice became the #1 show on tv you tried copying me with The Benefactor- a complete and total ratings disaster for @ABC. 

Only 1 mill.  dollars @mcuban?  Offer me real money and I’d consider it.  Your team and networks lose so much money I doubt you have much left! 

. @mcuban tries so hard to be a star and he truly doesn't have what it takes and never will!. 

Dummy @mcuban is at it again trying to use me to get publicity for himself! 

In ’08, America voted for Hope & Change.   Instead, we got incompetency.   Now it is time to put a real job creator in office.  Vote 4 Mitt! 

Obama’s policies have led to food stamp rolls growing 75X faster than job production    We can't afford 4 more years. 

@Newsday My @foxandfriends interview discussing @newsday’s endorsement of @MittRomney, tomorrow's election and Sandy's victims. 

Nice mention by Brian Kelly   Conservative Action Alerts\. 

We can't destroy the competitiveness of our factories in order to prepare for nonexistent global warming.  China is thrilled with us! 

@newyorkpost Great article in the @NewYorkPost by Ben Garrett--"Don't Blame Sandy on Global Warming". 

It’s extremely cold in NY & NJ—not good for flood victims.  Where is global warming? 

Get out tomorrow and vote so that we can all finally say those magic words---. 

Thank you to @piersmorgan for your nice statement about me in the @HollywoodReporter. 

. @CNN is looking at Jeff Zucker to lead them out of the forest--Jeff would be a great choice. 

Remember, go vote--we need real change this time. 

@Lorrainejuliet @EDLTrobinson @FloridaJayhawk @hannityshow  Must be careful & smart!

@ConEdison Like @conedison, Obama is incompetent! 

@ConEdison @conedison is incompetent and will have tremendous liability to Briarcliff Manor and Trump National! 

@ConEdison @conedison doesn't even respond to the people in Briarcliff... like a forgotten area. 

@ConEdison @conedison is terrible... don't know what they are doing.  Trump National Briarcliff and all houses are totally blacked out! 

@MittRomney will turn this mess around! 

Make sure you get out and vote... most important election of our generation... go Romney! 

Trump Hotels are delivering lots of food to storm victims... we love doing it! 

Gary Johnson is asking people "to waste" their vote on him.  Make it count - vote for @MittRomney. 

We don’t want to have a recount in any of the battleground states.  Obama will steal it.  Make sure all your friends and family vote. 

Obama's war on women has lead to the biggest decline in female employment in 40 years.  4 more years?? 

. @JoeBiden is out on the trail saying "you'll vote for me in 2016. " Is he serious? 

Undecideds in OH,PA and WI will make the difference.  All should ask themselves if they want $6/gallon gas because it will come under Obama. 

Pennsylvania is in play @MittRomney.  All undecideds in Philly suburbs should ask themselves - who do you trust most on @Israel? 

I think @TheRevAl should take this challenge.  Axelrod was too scared.  RT: @RonKaufmanIntrn: Kaufstache vs.  Sharpstache. 

In the heart of the city, Trump International Toronto is the city's most elite property    True luxury at its finest. 

Considering Obama hasn’t proposed anything concrete, if he wins he won’t have a mandate.   Another 4 years of legislative stalemate. 

Members from Obama's own job council are endorsing @MittRomney    Not surprising\. 

Concerns over the national debt are stopping businesses from hiring and expanding   Obama's policies are unsustainable\. 

Castro, Chavez and Ahmadinejad are all anxiously awaiting our election results.   They are praying Obama wins. 

Obama promised 5. 2% unemployment by October 2012.   His promises are worthless!

Obama has destroyed the middle class.   In ’09, median household income was $55,198.   Now it is $50,678.   Four more years? 

I have an idea for A-Rod---buy a home at @TrumpGolfLA overlooking the Pacific--will bring you better luck. 

A-Rod is now looking for an expensive home in Beverly Hills--why aren't the @Yankees terminating his contract for misrepresentation? 

@Eagles . @eagles should sit Michael Vick.  He is a great athlete but less than average quarterback. 

Obama our Welfare & Food Stamp President, is praising himself for expanding welfare    He doesn't believe in work. 

"We don't need a Secretary of Business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and I do" -- @MittRomney\. 

Unemployment is now 7. 9%.   Four years and $6. 5T later, that is really bad! 

@simonsam  It is Trump water--thanks. 

How about President Obama fixing the gasoline situation instead of taking photo ops in the destruction. 

. @maggiepolitico is an unprofessional hack who belongs @politico with all the other Obama hacks. 

Looks like @RalphGilles is full of it.   @dcexaminer: "Jeep, an Obama favorite, looks to shift production to China". 

Interestingly, the hurricane may now be a disaster for Obama's reelection because of his grandstanding. 

People are struggling to get gasoline for their cars--we are like a third world country. 

I'm sending lots of bottled water out to Staten Island & Long Island. 

. @TheRevAl came to my Trump Tower office to apologize for calling me a racist--very nice, apology accepted! 

. @BarbaraJWalters called my office to ask me to do election night coverage with her--sadly, I won't be able to do it. 

. @RalphGilles of Chrysler should focus on design rather than filthy language--not very professional. 

We should not allow @Chrysler to move @Jeep jobs to China after they said they wouldn't--stay tuned! 

. @Chrysler disputes my statement--but watch Chrysler move @Jeep jobs to China after the election. 

With long gas lines & total disarray from storm, the hurricane may yet be a negative for Obama. 

It was announced this morning that unemployment rose--this can't be good for Obama. 

Next year I will be changing the name of 800 acre Doral to Trump National Doral.  It will be the best resort in the country—Miami is hot! 

I will start reviewing various political reporters etc & websites as to their professionalism & fairness—many people asking for this. 

How could Obama leave those American heroes out to die in Benghazi?   And he continues to lie to the public! 

What is your thought as to why Obama refused millions for charity and did not show his records and applications? 

Nice to see Obama released a situation room photo from Sandy.   How about releasing the photo taken during Benghazi? 

Everybody knows why Obama would not show his college applications --- they are just not willing to say! 

If I would have offered Obama a billion dollars to show his records, he would have refused. 

My video response to President Obama's lack of transparency.. 

Press release.  Video response to follow.. 

I will soon be releasing my response to the fact that President Obama refused to show his applications and records to the public. 

President Obama missed the deadline! 

Obama is a terrible negotiator.  He bails out Chrysler and now Chrysler wants to send all Jeep manufacturing to China--and will! 

Why is Obama’s auto bailout now creating jobs in China?   He is ruining American industry. 

To all @MittRomney supporters, make sure you have taken advantage of early voting now so you can GOTV on election day. 

“Romney’s $2 Billion Sacrifice for America” By Chris Ruddy @Newsmax_Media. 

You know the world is crazy when New York gets hit by a hurricane-- and Florida doesn't. 

Let's continue to destroy the competitiveness of our factories & manufacturing so we can fight mythical global warming.  China is so happy! 

Do you believe @algore is blaming global warming for the hurricane? 

From 1954 to 1960 there were 10 major hurricanes that hit the East Coast. 

It's 10 AM: Two hours to go for Obama to easily pick up millions for charity! 

"The successful man will profit from his mistakes and try again in a different way. " -- Dale Carnegie\. 

@stass13 Thanks! 

Obama is now standing in a puddle acting like a President--give me a break. 

A lot of people are concerned about which charity my $5M will be donated to.   The onus is on Obama to first release his records. 

President Obama, if it is important to you, I will substantially increase the $5M offer! 

President Obama, please take the $5M check for charity tomorrow.  It is so easy and could do so much good! 

Thanks for all the nice words on my keeping the Trump Tower atrium accessible to stranded victims of #Sandy.  My honor. 

Obama met with Panetta and Biden at the White House during Benghazi attack    And he still did nothing. 

@newyorkpost Congratulations to @MittRomney on getting the @DMRegister, @NewYorkPost, @NewYorkObserver & @NashuaTelegraph endorsements! 

Spoiler--@dennisrodman has really got his act together so far on the upcoming season of @CelebApprentice... 

#TRUMP International Reality will be America’s premiere real estate brokerage house    w/ the most distinctive services. 

How does a dummy like @billmaher get a television show--& his ratings stink.  You'd think @HBO could do a lot better. 

A lot of undecided and independent voters have had enough with Obama’s lack of transparency.  I don't blame them. 

There is nothing I would be happier to do than to donate the $5M to a charity of Obama’s choice, once he releases all of his records. 

Looking at the figures and plans behind @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film makes you realize how stupid @AOL (cont). 

. @Disney's acquisition of Lucas Film is a smart deal for both sides.   Disney just bought a great brand which will keep producing revenue. 

In the spirit of transparency, Obama should immediately release the 9. 11 tape of Tyrone Woods pleading for military support in Benghazi. 

Today Barack Obama is standing in water in NJ.  Remember on election day that he has put the US underwater. 

How many illegal foreign donations will Obama collect this final week?  Another scandal ignored by the liberal media.. 

Congratulations Kevin Gabriel on your amazing article.  If I were a journalist this would be the next Watergate, and I would be a star. 

An amazing article by Kevin Gabriel-    A must read by friends and foes of President Obama.  End date is tomorrow at noon.

Part 2 of my @jimmyfallon interview giving away some @CelebApprentice spoilers & discussing 2012 Miss Universe Pageant. 

Part 1 of my @jimmyfallon interview discussing my $5M offer to Obama, #TRUMP Tower atrium, my tweets & 57th st.  crane. 

Kevin Garnett's response to Ray Allen last night was that of a great competitor--nothing wrong--in fact it was terrific.  A champion! 

@celtics I was standing with @SHAQ when a young high school star, Kevin Garnett @Celtics, said to a crowd "Forget Shaq, I want to meet Donald Trump. "

Watch the clip from @Late_Show where the crowd cheers after I explain that my offer is about transparency. 

I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity-- or to which charity the money will go. 

The President has until tomorrow at 12 noon to pick up $5M for his favorite charity.  Looking like he won't be doing it.  What is he hiding? 

Watch me tonight on Late Night with Jimmy Fallon. Photo: Lloyd Bishop/NBC. 

Not one Trump building, even those along the Hudson River, lost power --- a testament to quality systems and construction. 

The polls & momentum  are trending towards @MittRomney.  Don't let the hurricane change your thinking! 

Fans shouldn't worry.   We have adjusted the filming schedule of the upcoming 13th season of @CelebApprentice appropriately due to the storm. 

China’s stock market rose yesterday after 4 consecutive days of losses   Their market gains the day we are hit by storm\. 

Maybe Obama should donate my $5M to the families of the 17 who have lost loved ones during the storm? 

Scary.   Obama and the Democrat Senate have accrued over $5T worth of debt without passing a budget in the last 3 years.   4 more years? 

People are happy that I left the Trump Tower atrium open as opposed to taking the easy way out.. 

Why does Obama believe he shouldn't comply with record releases that his predecessors did of their own volition?  Hiding something? 

@digiphile @RedCross RT if you think Pres. Obama should release his records to get $5M for charity--for Red Cross or another great charity\. 

Glad to hear that @taylorswift13 will be co-hosting the Grammy nominations special on 12. 5.   Taylor is terrific! 

Let’s be honest, if Obama thought he could get away with campaigning during the storm, then he would have been in Ohio on Monday. 

How did Obama go to a Las Vegas fundraiser on 9. 12, the day after he refused to send help to Americans in Benghazi? 

"Without focus, it's just impossible to be successful at anything. " --Midas Touch\. 

I never fall for scams.   I am the only person who immediately walked out of my ‘Ali G’ interview\. 

Another great cause Obama could send my $5M donation to is a charity for 9/11 First Responders.  They are American heroes. 

My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the 57th St.  crane, damage from the storm and extending my $5M offer to Obama. 

My @extratv interview before Hurricane Sandy explaining that I would be staying in Trump Tower during the storm. 

These last 4 years have not had a single quarter over 4% GDP.  Obama has overseen the weakest economic recovery in American history. 

The election is trending towards @MittRomney.  Americans know we can't afford another 4 years of the Obama economic decline. 

So many incredible friends said thanks for TT help --- I say thanks to you!. 

The Trump Tower atrium is such a great place & kept thousands of people warm & safe during the storm--thanks, staff! 

. @MatthewLumby  Charity should get the money! 

@neilmsdunn Dopey, few have built more than me. 

Remember this: Obama wants to raise taxes, @MittRomney wants to lower taxes--need I say more! 

Don't let Obama buy the election by handing out unlimited free money to states. 

People having a great time in the Trump Tower atrium ---   unlike others, I stayed open.. 

I am the best builder but if that were my building with the crane mishap, I would have been lambasted from coast to coast. 

Because of the hurricane, I am extending my 5 million dollar offer for President Obama's favorite charity until 12PM on Thursday. 

Not only giving out money, but Obama will be seen today standing in water and rain like he is a real President --- don't fall for it. 

Hurricane is good luck for Obama again- he will buy the election by handing out billions of dollars. 

I saw from my window just before accident that the crane was not properly anchored for the storm. 

The water damage to NYC is amazing.  The winds were bad but the water was worse. 

All weights are on crane's wrong side ---  very precarious below, move out! 

If authorities need direct view from top of Trump Tower, call office. 

Direct view of crane from apartment window.  Crane was never properly secured, blowing in the breeze.. 

We are taking care of hundreds of people in the Trump Tower atrium--they are seeking refuge.  Free coffee and food. 

So far the hurricane is being handled very well in NY, not nearly as bad as stated on news.  Let's see what happens later. 

Many people walked out on Madonna's concert when she told them to vote for Obama.  Years ago I walked out because the concert was terrible! 

I always said Obama is lucky for himself but unlucky for the country.  The storm could be very good for him as he (cont). 

Obama lied 100% about Libya and the killings--emails are absolute.  He must release his records on Wednesday and stop the lies. 

Dave Letterman @Late_Show said during my interview that Obama was "probably" born in the US--the word "probably" is a disaster for Obama. 

I'm not hearing much from Obama or his administration about my $5M offer to charity or to which charity the money will go. 

@billmaher What people don't know about @BillMaher is that he was a terrible student and not considered smart in his early (cont). 

@billmaher . @BillMaher, who got thrown off ABC for being stupid, is always so nice to me to my face and constantly asking (cont). 

@billmaher I guess @BillMaher saw my ratings on the @Late_Show the other night where Letterman beat Leno.  Bill, you are no Letterman. 

While @BetteMidler is an extremely unattractive woman, I refuse to say that because I always insist on being politically correct. 

. @BetteMidler talks about my hair but I'm not allowed to talk about her ugly face or body --- so I won't.  Is this a double standard? 

But whenever she sees me, she kisses my ass.  She's disgusting.  @BetteMidler\. 

I never liked @BetteMidler's persona or singing and haven't heard her name in years. 

Now grotesque @BetteMidler is into the Trump act --- trying to becomerelevant again. 

Many people are saying that my challenge to Obama is having a huge negative effect on his poll numbers --- I agree. 

A lot changed when David Letterman said " he was probably born in this country"--- the word probably is a total disaster for Obama. 

I defended @StarJonesEsq against @NeNeLeakes on The Apprentice when @NeNeLeakes was making a fool out of her --- (cont). 

@TODAYshow I defended @StarJonesEsq when she lied about her stomach operation to lose weight --- only to get blindsided by her on the @todayshow. 

Before @StarJonesEsq begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was “professionally dead. ” I saved her tiny (cont). 

I am going to the @nyjets game with @woodyjohnson4, the owner of the team, a great guy. 

@JohnSununu @johnsununu is taking major heat for calling the president lazy.  But the president stated his weakness is that he is lazy.  Fight on John! 

@bernardmcguirk @BernardMcGuirk.  That's more than O'Reilly did ... and he is supposed to be my friend.  You're terrific! 

@bernard @Bernard McGuirk Thanks for being so nice and defending me on O'Reilly... you're terrific! 

Alert... The president knew that the ambassador was being attacked  in Benghazi.  He did nothing... he is no leader. 

@DonnyDeutsch tries so hard to be a star.  But, he just doesn't have what it takes... and he never will. 

I put @DonnyDeutsch on Apprentice at his request, I did his failed cable show as a favor to him then he knocks me for my Obama announcement. 

I want to end the day by saying there is no check I would rather write than that to a good charity designated by our President. 

The TODAY Show should call me about who to put on the show— I know more about people who get ratings than anyone. 

Before Star Jones begged me to put her on The Apprentice she was “professionally dead. ” I saved her tiny....

If Obama doesn't accept my offer to be fully transparent, what will he say? 

If my offer is refused, every undecided OH voter will be fully aware that Obama denied $5M to charity all because he is hiding something! 

Barack Obama has everything to gain.  Why would anyone ever deny $5M to charity? 

Great!  Last night @CelebApprentice winner @johnrich & alumni @RealMeatLoaf packed OH stadium rallying w/ @MittRomney.

I have decided to add a caveat to my offer.  Obama can't decide to send my $5M to Rev.  Wright if he releases his records. 

My fellow Tea Party friends in Ohio--make sure you take advantage of early voting so you can GOTV election day.  Know you can!  Must win Ohio. 

Where's the transparency?  Despite Obama's denial @sfchronicle stands by report he just talked with Jeremiah Wright. 

Looking forward to being the special guest at tonight's Dutchess County #GOP dinner--to a SOLD OUT crowd.  It will be great fun. 

Pretty audacious for Obama to call @MittRomney a BSer when he has lied about so much we don't have room to write. 

By the way, where is @Oprah?  Good question.  4 years ago she strongly supported Obama--now she is silent.  Anyway, who cares, I adore Oprah. 

... Colin Powell thought Iraq has weapons of mass destruction. 

Obama is about to destroy the mililtary through the sequester.  The Middle East is a mess.  Yet Colin Powell still endorses him.  Wonder why? 

Be careful of an Obama "bomb" to win election!  Would be a horrible thing to do. 

The election is still close but trending toward @MittRomney.  He leads all national polls and Obama's likeability is imploding.  VOTE! 

Wow!  Letterman show @Late_Show won the ratings last night big time--and guess who was his guest?  DJT\. 

One of my many Twitter followers suggested Obama should take my offer & give $1,250,000 to each family of the four.... 

Watch me explain on the @Late_Show how my charitable offer to Obama changes the election and is about transparency.

@crushthespirit  True! 

@HuffingtonPost What a dumb mistake AOL made buying the @huffingtonpost.  How much longer will Arianna last--I predict not much.

@MaureenPeronne @Late_Show  Thanks, it was a great show.. 

@MRJMF1 @Late_Show Thanks I will. 

@HuffingtonPost Stupid Arianna @huffingtonpost hired the man who ruined the once-great NYTimes Business Section...

@HuffingtonPost Dopey Arianna @huffingtonpost is really after me--boring story after boring story... but I hear she is in big trouble! 

I knew last year that @TIME Magazine lost all credibility when they didn't include me in their Top 100... 

...  I will soon start naming magazines that I think will fold--I predicted Newsweek. 

@yewkalaylee  Great idea. 

@seketa77  I hope so for the charity's sake\. 

@tylarreese @TylarReese Thanks Tylar\. 

The Letterman show really turned things around- people finally understand my $5 million dollar offer to charity..... 

@LianneOnLife I love the Wounded Warriors--Obama should choose that as his $5M charity. 

@RyanSeven Sounds like a good idea. 

@Erizzle05  Only because he has something to hide. 

. @SabrinaSiddiqui  Re: Taylor and Conor--great news for Taylor! 

Based on the ovation last night from the Letterman @Late_Show audience, I believe it will be hard for Obama to throw $5M down the drain.... 

.... instead of giving to a wonderful charitable cause. 

Another great charity that the $5M could go to just a recommendation to the Pres.  - the Wounded Warriors represented so well by @TraceAdkins\. 

Lots of response that Obama should give the $5M to the families of our great heroes who were murdered in Benghazi. 

Letterman @Late_Show was great last night.  I had a lot of fun.  You could see his audience really wanted Obama to take the $ for charity. 

"The dealmaker is cunning, secretive, focused and never settles for less than he wants. " --The America We Deserve\. 

It is really a shame that Barack Obama may stop $5M from being generously donated to charity all because he refuses to be transparent. 

Doing David Letterman @Late_Show tonight at 11:30.  1st nite of Sweeps. Going into the lion's den but I've been there many times before.  Enjoy\. 

Six days and counting until my offer to Barack Obama expires... 

For someone who demanded 20 years of Mitt's tax returns, you would think my offer to donate $5M to charity for his records is an easy go. 

Yesterday Barack Obama said he wants "wind turbines manufactured here in China"   I don't think this was a gaffe. 

China is primed to continue to rob us and steal our jobs through their exports    We need @MittRomney to rein them in. 

@Yankees I hope Derek Jeter’s recovery is going well.   He is a very special player and a great guy.   New York loves him.  @yankees\.

@michellemalkin I fully supported McCain but when he lost, hoped Obama would be great for U. S.  --- he wasn't. 

. @Mark_Sanchez shouldn’t be too upset over @EvaLongoria.   He will always do great! 

I am offering the chance for Barack Obama to redistribute $5M to any charity of his choice.   Everyone wins.   Take the deal.

Glad to hear North Carolina is solid for @MittRomney.   It started trending for Mitt solidly after my speech at the @NCGOP convention. 

In light the Benghazi emails released last night, it is apparent that Obama has no problem lying to the American public... 

...  By releasing his records, he can come clean with the American people and have $5 million go to a charity. 

Obama has no problem leaking national security secrets.   Why can't he release his records?   Especially when $5M is going to charity. 

I am happy to donate $5 million to a charity Barack Obama chooses.   All I am asking is that he is transparent with the American people\. 

RT @APCampaign:Trump to Obama: $5 million donation to charity if you release passport and college records   #Election2012\. 

I just learned that @politico has no credibility--total phonies that don't report the truth.  A puppet of Obama? 

Glad to hear @seanhannity supports my offer to Obama.   As Sean says “it is an easy $5 million to charity.   What does Obama have to lose? ”

Third rate @politico took every negative tweet or response they could find & put it out--when in fact the response is incredibly positive. 

My offer to Obama is about transparency.  In 2008, American people were sold on hope and change.  This our last chance to get the full record. 

RT @ReutersPolitics: Trump to give $5 million to charity if Obama releases records. 

Virtually all Presidents and candidates including John McCain, Bill Clinton, George H. W.  Bush, and George W.  Bush.... 

The response has been fantastic--- actually overwhelming!  Thank you!

@dailytelegraph Thank you to @DailyTelegraph reviewer @NeilMidgley who stated "'You've Been Trumped' was so biased in favour of the protesters... 

. @bobschieffer did an excellent job as debate moderator last night.  I only wish Mitt was more aggressive! 

Everyone is asking me to speak more on Robert & Kristen. I don't have time except to say "Robert, drop her, she cheated on you & will again! "

Last night was the first time Obama said "we" instead of "I" in respect to Bin Laden's killing. 

Barack Obama said absolutely not 3 times before he agreed to go after Bin Laden--- now he wants all of the credit! 

My announcement is tomorrow! 

Tomorrow I will be tweeting on only one subject! 

China will never go to war with us because if they won they would only take over property they already own! 

Mitt Romney must start congratulating the Navy Seals and military on Bin Laden’s killing, not the President. 

. @MittRomney should have been more aggressive last night.  Yet some polls have him winning the debate. 

My @SquawkCNBC interview discussing last night’s presidential debate, my stock picks and tomorrow’s big announcement. 

The military and Navy Seals should be given more credit for Bin Laden's death, not Obama, who works hard to take (cont). 

When the military informed Obama that they had Bin Laden, is there anyone with a brain that would not have said "Ok, go get him"? 

Doesn't the US have better things to do than to destroy an American hero for the world to see?  Now other (cont). 

Lance Armstrong fought for 7 years & then just ran out of energy.  Very sad story--although they caught him red handed. He definitely cheated! 

"Casting sometimes is fate and destiny more than skill and talent, from a director's point of view. " -- Steven Spielberg\. 

No matter what happens in the election, @davidaxelrod deserves a lot of credit.  He has kept Obama in it, even with his terrible record. 

I always said that @lancearmstrong had to keep fighting the charges.  By stopping, he gave his enemies an opening. 

70% of the Chinese say they are better off than they were 4 years ago    At least someone has done well under Obama. 

The debate was pretty even but I thought Mitt should have been much more aggressive on Obama's failed foreign policy-- and I mean much more. 

Debate was somewhat hard to watch last night.  Viewership will be way down. 

I will be doing @SquawkCNBC at 7:30. 

Stop congratulating Obama for killing Bin Laden.  The Navy Seals killed Bin Laden.  #debate\. 

. @MittRomney looks much calmer, and Obama should stop nodding his head backwards and forward. 

Bob Schieffer will do a great job tonight.  Always treated me fairly. 

Well this is it, the final debate- let's see how it goes.  I'll be tweeting live. 

I have watched @Linda_McMahon for years-- she will bring jobs & business back to Connecticut--incredible woman! 

My good friends in Connecticut have a great opportunity to send an amazing businesswoman to Washington.  Vote for @Linda_McMahon for Senate! 

Former Obama White House economic adviser @Austan_Goolsbee gave his old boss a 'C' on the economy    Pretty generous! 

@BRANDONTHRILL  Thanks--a great compliment. 

@trottofficial Thanks--and doing great business from all over the world. 

Why don't we ask the Navy SEALs who killed Bin Laden?  They don't seem to be happy with Obama claiming credit.  All he did is say O. K. 

. @piersmorgan keeps winning the ratings race @CNN    That’s why he is a @CelebApprentice Champion! 

I look forward to @MittRomney hitting Obama hard tonight for lying about Benghazi.  CIA told Obama it was a terrorist attack after 24 hrs. 

Everybody is asking about my announcement this Wednesday concerning Barack Obama---just wait and see! 

. @bobschieffer will a great job tonight--he is a real pro and respected by both sides. 

... even though Obama dumped the Reverend like Robert should dump Kristin. 

According to @SFGate, Obama spoke to Rev.  Wright about getting out the black vote    No surprise that they still speak... 

Everyone knows I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart.  In a couple of years, he will thank me.  Be smart, Robert. 

Obama is an easy target on foreign policy. @MittRomney has many openings to attack, especially when Obama starts bragging about Bin Laden. 

"This is my last election.  After my election I have more flexibility. " Obama to @MedvedevRussiaE discussing our nuclear arsenal. 

Congrats to Scotland's Sunday Post Newspaper for its front page article.

@LarryLivermore @tufnrs73  Dopey, I never went bankrupt. 

@DukePGA Ken--Thanks--I am proud of you.  Great job on tour this year--I always knew. 

@Patti0713 Thanks! 

@Yea4Country @politico  Thanks--it needs a lot of work. 

@AustinMay Austin--thanks! 

The brass in #TRUMP Tower's atrium is polished twice a month like clockwork.  I keep the atrium impeccable.  Key to its success! 

... now @AlexSalmond doesn't like me--who cares! 

I refused to comply with Scotland's First Minister @AlexSalmond's 'compassionate' treatment of terrorist Megrahi (Pan Am #103--270 dead)... 

The @BBC is widely criticized for a lack of professionalism.  We dealt with a Roger Mosey--a total lightweight who doesn't have a clue. 

@piersmorgan . @Toure I felt very sorry for you during your meltdown on @PiersMorgan.  He drove you insane but, of course, Piers is a lot smarter than you\. 

The @BBC is in total disarray.  I know personally how bad they are -- pathetic.. 

My son Don and his wife Vanessa just had a beautiful baby boy named Spencer Frederick --very thrilling. 

@kennedy_mac Dopey, I never went bankrupt\. 

Looking forward to my interview on the Howie Carr Show at 5:30PM today.   Tune in New Hampshire!. 

Last week I had @SInow's tweet of the week and the most retweeted @MittRomney mention twice .   Can anyone else top that?   Don't think so! 

Had a great time watching the @nyjets @Patriots game yesterday at Gillette Stadium.  Great and exciting game. 

The Lion, The Witch And Donald Trump's Wardrobe"   By @AbeGarver @Forbes\. 

I wish tonight's debate would cover more than foreign policy. 

Visiting Virginia?  Be sure to visit the Trump Vineyard Estates in Charlottesville   Winner of the Five Star Diamond Award\. 

Don't let Obama play the Iran card in order to start a war in order to get elected--be careful Republicans! 

. @Toure, when you are fired from MSNBC for your bad ratings and racist coverage, stop by and say hello. 

Autism rates through the roof--why doesn't the Obama administration do something about doctor-inflicted autism.  We lose nothing to try. 

We should march on Washington re:autism--with leadership & common sense the numbers would drop precipitously! 

Lots of autism and vaccine response.  Stop these massive doses immediately.  Go back to single, spread out shots!  What do we have to lose.

My @foxandfriends interview discussing Lance Armstrong losing his titles, Obama's foreign policy & my BIG announcement. 

Stay tuned for my big Obama announcement--- probably on Wednesday.  

People are going crazy with my comments on Diet Coke (soda).  Let's face it--this stuff just doesn't work.  It makes you hungry. 

The anti-wind turbine movement in Scotland against @AlexSalmond is amazing--keep going Scots, save your country! 

Obama should stop talking about wind turbines--they are a disaster for a country or community & are very expensive & unreliable. 

I will be live tweeting during the debate tonight. 

Derek, get well soon, the @Yankees need youl. 

Gas prices are at crazy levels--fire Obama! 

Sleepy Eyes @chucktodd owes @jack_welch an apology.  Jack is right on unemployment--the new jobless claims make 7. 8% an impossibility. 

"They succeed, because they think they can. " -- Virgil\. 

Don Butler and executives are doing a great job at @Cadillac--- the cars are fantastic. 

The biggest problem with A-Rod is he is bad for the chemistry of the Yankees--- he must go. 

Fort Hood shooting should be declared a terror attack.  Respect the wounded and dead. 

Good luck to Derek on his operation.  I know it will be a success--- he is a great champion. 

Derek must move back into one of my buildings immediately.  It will be lucky for him like in past. 

Derek Jeter broke ankle one day after he sold his apartment in Trump World Tower. 

7. 8% unemployment number is a complete fraud as evidenced by the jobless claims number released yesterday. Real unemployment is at least 15%

. @MittRomney's @RNC convention came in over $3M under budget.   Barack’s @DNC convention is over $10M in debt.   What a surprise! 

No surprise, welfare spending is up over 30% under Obama.     He is the food stamp & welfare "king"

Can't wait for @VanityFair to fold which, under Graydon Carter, will be sooner rather than later. 

. @VanityFair's terrible piece on Mitt's faith is a new low, even for them. 

Where were all the @VanityFair exposes on "When Rev.  Wright disciples go to Washington? "  Sad! 

Follow @MELANIATRUMP's jewelry line on @QVC site. 

Rev.  @BillyGraham is a great man and so is his son, Franklin Graham. 

Rev. @BillyGraham is doing tremendous work this election cycle educating the Christian community on @MittRomney. 

Both Barack and @MittRomney were excellent at the Al Smith dinner last night! 

A lot of the @Yankees should be ashamed of their play in the post season.  They are lucky they don't have to deal with George Steinbrenner. 

I hope @boyscouts of America handle their problems a lot better than the board at Penn State did.  You can't do any worse! 

@rginn_1 Toledo is a great place--I've been there & worked in Cincinnati for 2 years--I love Ohio. 

@RickyTheBitch @ladygaga I think Gaga is great--her 1st major appearance at my Miss Universe Pageant in Vietnam/6 yrs ago Should give me 25%

Newly released NH poll has @MittRomney with a 1 point lead.  Mitt will pull away next week. 

Obama has called Libya attack "a bump in the road" and "not optimal. " Just come clean already--tell Americans the truth! 

Maybe Derek Jeter should ask A-Rod about renting his apartment next year.  Very soon A-Rod won't need a place in NYC. 

Yes--I will be live tweeting during the final debate this coming Monday.

Some of you were asking about the All-Star line-up for Celebrity Apprentice. 

So many tweets & stories on Stewart/Pattinson Look, it doesn't matter-- the relationship will never be the same.  It is permanently broken. 

@D_Hastie @lancearmstrong  No, I said U. S.  destroyed a once American icon\. 

Congratulations to Bernie Marcus & Herman Cain @JobCreatorsUSA on the #TruthTour2012--All employers need to check this out! 

For the truth about job creation in America go to    A great site for employers to get the tools & information they need! 

. @lancearmstrong really blew it--went down in flames--too bad! 

I guess they don’t have freedom of the press in Scotland.  We created this ad and the ASA would not allow us to (cont). 

Why would Ohio listen to Bruce Springsteen reading his lines?  Be careful or I will go to Ohio and @MittRomney will win it! 

@JakfromBk Thanks! 

@MisterJoe49 @Yankees I agree, but their careers weren't fueled by drugs. 

Obama said "not optimal" to Ambassador & embassy killings--bad word usage for a Harvard graduate. 

. @MittRomney did a great job last night.  Watch the clip!. 

@evaemery Never give up.  You have what it takes. 

Great decision by Donald Graham @Newsweek to sell.  I'll now have to take my newsweek covers off the wall. 

With Barry Diller & Tina Brown in charge, did anyone doubt that @Newsweek would be a massive failure? 

It is a great honor to have helped the community so much.. 

Something really bad happened to the @Yankees psyche--much like our President! 

. @Yankees should get rid of A-Rod ASAP--I can't watch this guy anymore! 

. @evaemery Thanks--you sound great! 

@Rosie @realDonaldTrump  Thanks for the info Rosie--get well. 

I'll be making a major announcement on President Obama next week--stay tuned! 

Can't believe we are less than three weeks away from the election.  Time certainly flies! 

"A penny saved is a penny earned. " -- Benjamin Franklin\. 

The Yankees are absolutely terrible--- what happened to this team? 

@gastronome2  I love India! 

Hey @Rosie--how is your recovery going?  I hope you are doing well so we can start fighting again soon! 

@waycooljr37 @Nationals Bob Kraft & Coach Bill are far too smart! 

@YouthPastorDarr @seanhannity @megynkelly @JohnCena Good luck! 

@toddulu @Nationals I hope that's the reason--otherwise, just plain stupid. 

@donmarie16  A total professional. 

@CalumSpence Greatly appreciated, thanks. 

@Morali_Arch Great to meet you also. 

@NeanderthalMan1 @MittRomney  I was referring, of course, to Bill Clinton's statement on the economy. 

@crazymom28 I have a friend that wants to meet your sister. 

My Trump Home Mattress Collection by Serta is setting records--they are really phenomenal.  You can order them at. 

The last time I visited China I couldn't believe all the construction.  You can go up with a project in a week--no red tape. 

It's Thursday.  How much money did Barack Obama waste today on crony green energy projects? 

Clinton commented in Ohio today that @MittRomney is right, the economy has not been fixed under Obama. I always said Bill was an honest man. 

When Strasburg leaves @Nationals for another team for more money, will Washington still like the decision to shut him down for his good? 

Bad sign for Obama's campaign now publicly admitting they are focused on 4 states.  Their internals must be horrendous. 

While the next season of @CelebApprentice is packed w/ All Stars, ours fans will be happy to see @Joan_Rivers in the board room. She is back! 

@Yankees Derek Jeter @yankees wants to rent an apartment.  Derek--only in a Trump building--Trump is lucky for you. 

Now there is talk of A-Rod being shipped to @Marlins.  If A-Rod is not a @yankee next year, the fans will be happy. 

@Yankees I think the @yankees will win today.  Unlike A-Rod, CC is good under pressure.  I hope A-Rod plays, however. 

@NickJ102 @antbaxter I don't want to fall asleep in public. 

Robert I'm getting a lot of heat for saying you should dump Kristen- but I'm right.  If you saw the Miss Universe girls you would reconsider. 

@Yankees My @extratv interview with @MarioLopezExtra discussing my @yankees tweets, A-Rod's slump & the presidential debates.

@jeff_coles  I will--thanks. 

Lots of response to my Pattinson/Kristen Stewart reunion.  She will cheat again--100 certain--am I ever wrong? 

Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family & the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner\. 

Alert--US jobless claims up 46,000 to 388,000.  Really bad news.  7. 8% is now a fraud--not possible! 

Amazing--my tweets are covered across every spectrum from @espn to @politico to @WSJ. 

"When we're talking about math that doesn't add up, how about $5 trillion of deficits over the last four years. " --@MittRomney\. 

Obama's spending and borrowing is burying America and destroying our children's future.  Does he even care? 

@macy #SuccessByTrump, exclusively available @Macy's, has set sale records for fastest selling cologne.  Makes a great gift. 

Great--now Supreme Court Justices are talking about a constitutional right to a cell phone   Obama, just stop already.

Mitt's proposed tax cuts for the middle class will spur record economic growth. 

Major grudge match this weekend between @nyjets & @Patriots.  I have a dilemma, I am good friends w/ both Woody (cont). 

Under his administration, oil and gas production on public land is down over 10%    Obama did not tell truth last night. 

If Obama goes after Mitt's private sector experience in the next debate then Mitt should ask for Obama's college records--all of them. 

I find it very sad that we have a President with zero private sector experience attacking an opponent for being successful. 

@MystikAngel . @mystikangel  Bring @johnrich back?  He is back!

What is never said is that people take a big risk with their money and can lose it all.  We should be given credit for taking this risk. 

Can you imagine how embarrassing it would have been for the country if the candidates actually did get into a fist fight? 

Robert Pattinson should not take back Kristen Stewart.  She cheated on him like a dog & will do it again--just watch.  He can do much better! 

@Eagles Michael Vick of the Philadelphia @eagles is a great athlete but not a great quarterback. 

Initial reports say 2nd debate viewership dropped.  See what happens when I am not mentioned. 

Just read about my friend @HulkHogan--he was set up--too bad he has to use the court system instead of his muscles. 

@BillRancic  Bill- You should have named your beautiful son Donald. 

Joe Girardi @Yankees must play his starters, even A-Rod, they got you there. 

While the @Yankees look like they quit and are finished, they won't quit for CC\. 

Last Saturday A-Rod was 0-3 and left 6 stranded.  But he was still hitting on girls from the dugout    He is very selfish! 

CC is a great pitcher and can handle pressure--@Yankees will win tonight.  So far my predictions have all been correct. 

@Yankees George Steinbrenner @yankees would have gotten out of A-Rod's contract three years ago... but put A-Rod in tonight. 

Obama talks about what he is going to do--why the hell didn't he just do it, especially in the first 2 years when he had all votes necessary\. 

Obama at big debate disadvantage--he just can't get away from his bad record. 

. @MittRomney scored last night on both substance and style. 

"Trump Was Right: 'Obama's America' Tops 2012 Documentaries"     via @Newsmax_Media\. 

... Bad decisions can be devastating. 

Obama was beaten but not knocked out.   He lives to fight another day.  But in the real world presidents are not given a second chance... 

All the guys that said @MittRomney would lose are rapidly coming on board.   Mitt will remember the early helpers. 

If Obama keeps pushing wind turbines our country will go down the tubes economically, environmentally & aesthetically. 

@nypost Robert Bryce @NYPost--Congrats on your great opinion piece on terrible wind turbines & how destructive they are.  Windmills are a disaster. 

Remember, new "environment friendly"  lightbulbs can cause cancer.  Be careful-- the idiots who came up with this stuff don't care. 

Wind turbines are not only killing millions of birds, they are killing the finances & environment of many countries & communities. 

@nypost Great article on wind turbines by Robert Bryce in today's @NYPost. 

@Yankees Really enjoyed discussing @yankees yesterday with @RealMicihaelKay.  I am a long time Yankee fan. 

Via @espn: "Donald Trump would fire A-Rod". 

@marileenelson Thanks\. 

@Yankees My interview with @RealMichaelKay discussing why A-Rod should be fired from @yankees & how to terminate his contract. 

My twitter followers will soon be over 2 million--& all the "biggies. " It's like having your own newspaper. 

My twitter has become so powerful that I can actually make my enemies tell the truth. 

Polls are starting to look really bad for Obama.  Looks like he'll have to start a war or major conflict to win.  Don't put it past him! 

Obama did much better than he did last time--but still lost decisively. 

Do you believe Barack Hussein Obama (aka Barry Soetoro) looked like a president last night?  I don't! 

Obama has zero credibility on oil and coal.  If we do not win energy as a country, we just do not win, period! 

I still love Derek, he is a winner! 

Remember, I said Derek don't sell your Trump World Tower apartment... its been lucky for you.  The day after he sold it, he broke his foot. 

At the debate, the President kept talking of what he is going to do.  I kept saying, why didn't he do it?   He lost me a long time ago. 

Verlander pitched great, but @Yankees look truly defeated. 

Stupid George Will gave @MittRomney no chance 3 months ago.  Take off his little spectacles and he's just another dummy. 

George Will said "best debate he ever saw".  If you ever heard George Will speak(boring) anything is exciting. 

Debate showed--- these guys really hate each other.  At one point it looked like they would come to blows.  

Obama better than last time, but again, @MittRomney wins.  Good night.  #debate\. 

You talk tough, Mr.  President, but have done nothing about China killing our jobs and economy. 

Such long rhetorical and boring answers from Obama.  No wonder nothing gets done. 

. @MittRomney much better on Libya and Middle East problems.  Obama has no answer. 

Obama keeps namedropping Bill Clinton-- he is no Bill Clinton. 

Obama weak on immigration.  All words, no action.  He's been Prez 4 years. 

Obama is looking rhetorical and weak.  @MittRomney is looking strong and sharp. 

Obama just said @MittRomney was "a very successful investor"--- big mistake for Obama to admit- he has less and less credibility. 

Obama keeps saying that he will do something--- but why hasn't he done it?  It's all talk. 

. @MittRomney looks much stronger and much more Presidential! 

So far @MittRomney is winning big. 

Then how come gasoline is hitting record high prices? 

Good response on jobs by @MittRomney. 

Why has Obama let China and others take our jobs? 

Why hasn't Obama created jobs? 

Getting ready to watch the debate--- as they say "let's get ready to rumble"! 

I was just told by one of the top @PGATOUR players that my golf courses are the most elite in the country.  Very nice compliment--I agree. 

We should be able to negotiate a deal with Iran because they know we could blow them away to the Stone Age. They just don't believe we would. 

@drumline_mormon  It is selling great at Macy's--thanks! 

For political purposes only, Obama is planning to hit Libya for the Benghazi embassy attack right before the election? 

@denver_broncos Great win last night by Peyton Manning & @Denver_Broncos in San Diego coming from 24 points behind on the road.  Very impressive. 

@Yankees If the @yankees can somehow beat Verlander tonight then they can still salvage the series.  And I will go to games 6& 7 so they will win! 

Get ready for tonight! 

@MissUSA  Olivia--we love you.  You are doing a great job. 

. @MittRomney--if Obama gets wise tonight just ask for his college records & transcripts--he will quiet down quickly. 

Good luck @MittRomney tonight--have no doubt you will be great. 

Congratulations to @JamesOKeefeIII on exposing more Democrat voter fraud.   @DNC was caught red handed telling people to vote twice. 

I bet the terrorists in Libya used weapons we supplied them during their so called 'revolution' to attack our embassy in Benghazi. 

@WashTimes . @washtimes "@BrettMDecker: Five Questions w/ @realDonaldTrump--'Lack of Leadership is the biggest threat to America'". 

Between Libya, the national security leaks and Fast & Furious, Obama has had more national security scandals than any other President. 

@Reince . @reince is doing a fantastic job for the Republican Party--hope he gets the credit he deserves. 

. @antbaxter I tried watching but fell asleep. 

@HISTORY . @History's wonderful "The Men Who Built America" with me on tonight at 9 -- bad timing, I'll be live tweeting the debate\. 

Because Obama was so pathetic in the first debate, tonight's audience will be humongous--people want to see if he is for real. 

The Coca Cola company is not happy with me--that's okay, I'll still keep drinking that garbage. 

@FoxNews It's amazing--my weekly scheduled interviews on @foxnews and @CNBC draw the highest ratings.  And they get bigger week by week--thanks folks! 

@paulryanvp Had a great time with @PaulRyanVP last night on the Intrepid.  Paul is terrific. 

Obama just had another trillion dollar budget deficit for the fourth year in a row.  At least he is consistent. 

All the morons that cause the controversy in Scotland have made my development far more successful than anticipated. 

My #TrumpTuesday @SquawkCNBC interview discussing the stakes for tonight's debate and the state of my stock portfolio. 

Diet Coke tweet had a monster response--dammit, I wish the stuff worked. 

. @antbaxter  Thanks for helping promote & make Trump International Golf Links Scotland so successful--you stupid fool! 

. @antbaxter  Your documentary died many deaths.  You have, in my opinion, zero talent. 

I can confirm the reports--@BillRancic, my first season winner, will be returning to this All-Star season of @CelebApprentice. 

. @rupertmurdoch is absolutely right, it will be a nightmare for @Israel if Obama is re-elected. 

Verlander is great but  very beatable.  Does not have a good ERA in playoff games\. 

I turned down going to the debate tonight so that I could do live tweets to my many followers. 

I have no doubt that Mitt will do really well tonight.  We'll all be watching @MittRomney. 

Lots of pressure on Obama tonight--even more than A-Rod.  If he doesn't perform well it could be over. 

I hope A-Rod has a great night for the Yankees--he owes it to them--especially with Derek hurt.

Looking forward to honoring the great Dogan family and the success of the Trump Towers project in Istanbul @FollowTurkey Annual Gala Dinner\. 

@Yankees A-Rod should donate his contract to charity.  He doesn't make the @yankees any money and he doesn't perform.  He is a $30M/yr rip off.

My @foxandfriends interview discussing @JoeBiden's performance, the Libya cover up and tomorrow's crucial debate. 

Barack Obama is not who you think he is.  Most overrated politician in US history.

. @ArsenioOFFICIAL Why not everyone else is using it--- it's available at @Macys. 

@SchroedBoss @ErichFSchroeder  and your parents meant the world to me\. 

A-Rod was a great player when he lived at Trump Park Avenue--- even though he was on the juice! 

@mcginness1 Thanks--a great country\. 

Derek Jeter had a great career until 3 days ago when he sold his apartment at Trump World Tower- I told him not to sell- karma? 

. @SbelSbel3555  Sorry, @piersmorgan is a very smart guy! 

. @ErichFSchroeder Your dad was a great man & great leader. 

@leighannmac @LeighAnnMac Thank you\. 

I love @LibertyUniversity--such great people! 

A-Rod is just not making it.  We want to give him a chance but it was only drugs that made him great. 

@Yankees I feel guilty not having attended the last two @yankees games (losses).   They would have won! 

Obama will be trying very hard at next debate- he doesn't want to lose the Boeing. 

Who says Obama will do better in the next debate- has he gotten smarter in 2 weeks! 

. @MittRomney's poll numbers are looking really good.  One more great debate performance and it will be a total knockout.  

I have never seen a thin person drinking  Diet Coke. 

No, I wasn't at the @Yankees game yesterday- can't go today either.  When I go, they win. 

Brooklyn Nets have the worst uniform ever- Boring- won't matter if they win("Winning solves all problems"- (cont). 

Yankees can win today.  Kuroda is a highly underrated pitcher. 

A-Rod hit ball hard first at bat.  Time for him to step up and leave. 

Swisher should have caught ball in right field last night. 

. @Yankees are in trouble without Derek.  Try A-Rod at short- get him some confidence. 

A bad thing finally happened to Derek Jeter--- he is a great champion. 

So much for Washington shutting down Strasburg- they deserved to lose. 

Roadway steel on beautiful Verrazano-Narrows Bridge is rusting and rotting away.  Scrape and paint before too late. 

Tonight, despite everything, put A-Rod in the lineup.  

Everyone's wondering what's wrong with A-Rod.  Not one sports writer blames it on his not being able to use drugs anymore-- the real reason.  

They found Jessica in Colorado--- body was mutilated--- death to the pervert killer. 

Joe Girardi did a great job of managing the Yankees this series. 

I'll bet Obama goes down just like Washington because he doesn't use our(this country's) best people to win. 

Washington should have brought in Strasburg to relieve-- they would have won. 

When Strasburg leaves in a couple of years under free agency Washington will say " what were we doing". 

I told you, whenever I go to a @Yankees game the @Yankees win. 

"Leadership is the capacity to translate vision into reality. " -- Warren G.  Bennis\. 

When an employee leaves me and begs to come back--I never let them.  Loyalty is very important. 

I look forward to Tuesday night's presidential debate--I wonder if Obama will use my name again. 

Very different styles but each totally effective in his own way at the debate. 

@paulryanvp "What we are watching on our TV screens is the unraveling of the Obama foreign policy. " --@PaulRyanVP\. 

Obama's economic policies are causing inflation on hard working families.  The price of corn alone has risen over 200% since he was elected. 

With our amazing All Star cast, @Joan_Rivers, @johnrich, @ArsenioOFFICIAL & @piersmorgan are also returning as boardroom advisors. 

Great to hear that our loyal @CelebApprentice fans are happy with today's announcement of the new cast.  This will be something special! 

. @dennisrodman looks like he really cleaned up his act. 

I'm going to the @Yankees game tonight to root them on--they always win when I am there. 

My Scotland course is receiving accolades from all over the world--a great honor for me. 

Credibility is important to me- hence must admit that both candidates did really well last night.  #VPDebate\.

Pretty even debate- no knockouts.  However Ryan's closing statement somewhat stronger.  What do you think?  #VPDebate\. 

Biden's statements on Medicare are very effective.  Ryan must now come back and combat.  #VPDebate\. 

Excellent story on @MittRomney- very good moment for Ryan.  #VPDebate\. 

Pretty even debate but don't force Obama into a war--- he would be the wrong leader.  #VPDebate\. 

Biden's sarcastic smiling may or may not be effective depending on who is watching.  #VPDebate\. 

Hard for Biden to justify Libya mess but doing best he can.  #VPDebate\. 

Both candidates are looking sharp- now it's up to the mouth and the mind.  #VPDebate\. 

Get ready- this should be informative and fun!  #VPDebate\. 

Looking forward to the debate tonight and will be tweeting live with very honest assessment. 

. @Linda_McMahon is an elite businesswoman who will bring a great outlook to DC.  Support her campaign here. 

If Obama's poll numbers continue to fall, I expect him to launch a military strike somewhere before the final debate. 

Another sign that @jack_welch is right.  New government labor report casts even more doubt on the September jobs data. 

Why does Barack Obama's ring have an arabic inscription?    Who is this guy? 

It's Thursday and only 26 days until the election.  How many illegal donations from China and Saudi Arabia did Obama collect today? 

So Obama used to tell classmates that he was Kenyan royalty and an Indonesian prince    Sounds like his book bio! 

Our foreign policy decisions are dumbest in U. S.  history\. 

Live tweeting during tonight's VP debate... should be a great time\. 

How the hell does the Libyan government get off telling our embassy security they can't have loaded guns for protection?! 

Why the hell did we help the Libyan "rebels" in the first place.  That is the real scandal. 

Outright disgusting--the Obama administration has continually stonewalled and lied to US Amb.  Sean Smith's mother. 

I suspect @JoeBiden could do well tonight.  Don't be fooled by his gaffes.  He is a seasoned and feisty debater. 

If @rihanna is dating @chrisbrown again then she has a death wish.  A beater is always a beater--just watch! 

@Yankees Amazing that Derek Jeter played with an injury throughout most of last night's @yankees game and did so well. 

@Yankees $30M a year and A-Rod is now relegated to the bench.  @yankees would have lost if Girardi hadn't benched him in the 9th (see my prediction)

I guess they have Lance Armstrong cold.  Brutal report.  A waste of taxpayer money to take down an American hero. 

@TODAYshow @ApprenticeNBC . @Apprenticenbc cast will be announced tomorrow at 7:30am ET on the @todayshow with @MLauer\. 

Staff at Trump Park Avenue disliked A-Rod--to put it "mildly" -- The staff at Trump World Tower loves Derek Jeter. 

Asking why my dislike of A-Rod--dishonorable dealings with me on an apartment deal\. 

Great move to take A-Rod out of game.  Now terminate his contract based on misrepresentation (drugs). 

Raul Ibanez did something never done in baseball history.  Amazing move by manager Joe G. 

After Obama's '07 racist speech on Katrina relief, he now won't provide any aid to victms of Hurricane Isaac. 

USA Today has the worst "new" newspaper logo in the business--go back to the original! 

Traveling to LA this winter?  Book a round at Trump Nat'l Golf Club   Rated best course on the West Coast (& best food)

"When everything seems to be going against you, remember that the airplane takes off against the wind, not with it. " -- Henry Ford\. 

@usa67us  Thank you\. 

Must read article on Obama's illegal fundraising from abroad    Foreign candidate getting foreign donations. 

I enjoy meeting tourists in #TrumpTower.  People travel from across the world to see the five-level Atrium & waterfall. 

Congratulations to @FLGovScott on getting an "A" grade from @CatoInstitute on his fiscal policy.  Rick is a fantastic governor. 

Even with lower profit projections, American firms are still throwing money into China    Obama is killing investment. 

I am more concerned about Biden in the debate than I am about Obama.  Be careful on Thursday night! 

"You have to scratch your head when the president spends the last week talking about saving Big Bird. "  -- @MittRomney\. 

Consumer spending fell in September    Another indicator the 7. 8% unemployment number is cooked. 

A-Rod must be dropped in the Yankees line-up tonight if they want to win.  He simply can't perform without drugs. 

Obama was guest at VP debate moderator Martha Raddatz's wedding    Do people think this is fair? 

Receiving thousands of thank you letters from @LibertyU students for my convocation speech.  The honor was all mine!   Great people. 

DELUSIONAL--Obama actually thought that he won the debate   What is he thinking? 

47M on food stamps.  Over 23M Americans unemployed.  50% of college grads unemployed.  And Obama wants us talking about Big Bird. 

Has Barack Obama been caught red handed laundering money into his campaign from illegal online foreign donations?  Media? 

I just had to fire someone, he didn't have a clue--he reminded me of Obama on Wednesday night. 

27 days until America's greatest test since our founding.  In this election, we decide whether we become great again. 

"It doesn't matter who you vote for--it matters who is counting the votes. " Be careful of voter fraud! 

Obama is under a great of pressure to perform well in the next debate.  Let's see how he reacts under pressure. 

Remember, Obama limped across the finish line--he should have lost to Hillary.  Be careful! 

I don't think Obama will do well in the second debate--he is psyched out just like A-Rod. 

"I will implement effective missile defenses to protect against threats.  On this, there will be no flexibility with Vladimir Putin. " -- Mitt\. 

How can British PM Cameron spend so much money on Scottish windmills which are ruining the countryside? 

By popular request I will also be tweeting live during the Vice Presidential debate  Thursday night.  It will be very interesting, I promise. 

. @DavidLetterman @Late_Show fully apologized last night for calling me a racist.  Thank you David--we are again friends. 

The public is about to learn a lot more information on Barack Obama and his true background in the coming weeks…

Now that Obama’s poll numbers are in tailspin – watch for him to launch a strike in Libya or Iran.   He is desperate. 

Mitt’s subsequent rise in the polls post-debate shows that the American public can still spot a real winner. 

“In order to build your wealth and improve your business smarts, you need to know about real estate. ” - Think Like a Billionaire\. 

With these record high gas prices, what does it say about Obama that he was trying to brag about his energy policy in the debate? 

Looking forward to live tweeting during the rest of the debates.  Will be a lot of fun. 

When will the unemployment numbers be corrected?  Sadly, after the election! 

"Donald Trump: ‘Monkey business’ on jobs"   via @politico\. 

George Will is a political moron.  Last month he said Romney couldn't win. 

In the end, Andy Pettitte did not rat out his friend Roger Clemens.  I like him again, a lot. 

Drop A-Rod in the order and cut his salary based on unreported drug use.  Also, not a pressure player. 

My @SquawkCNBC #TRUMPTUESDAY interview discussing the upcoming debates, the real state of unemployment & bias media. 

Why isn't Obama protecting us from ridiculous gas prices? 

California gas prices going thru the roof, others to follow.  An election-losing event for Obama. 

Greece should get out of the euro & go back to their own currency--they are just wasting time. 

. @ErraticSLK  Shout out = work hard! 

. @carlosbeltran15 is playing great for St.  Louis Cardinals.  They made a wise decision. 

. @jack_welch is correct--these reporters would not have been so brave while Jack was running GE. 

Our many loyal viewers should expect a major announcement very soon on next season's @CelebApprentice.  Our fans will be pleased. 

Sleepy eyes @chucktodd -- whenever you mention me unfairly I will likewise mention you. 

Obama projected a 2012 budget deficit of $557B.   It is actually double that at $1. 1T    We can't afford four more years. 

Welcome to Obama's recovery - government workers' unemployment rate has fallen to 4. 3%.     We need private sector growth. 

China is taking the oil in Libya while our embassy is being attacked after we won the war for the rebels.  Obama's policies suck! 

Obama's planned tax hike will hit over 1 million small businesses   Expect more massive unemployment and stagnant growth\. 

@bigtigga12  Work hard, love what you do, keep focused, never lose your momentum. 

How long did it take for Obama to call Hugo Chavez and congratulate him on his 'reelection? ' Who do you think Chavez supports in ours? 

Congratulations to @drewbrees on setting the @NFL record with 48 consecutive games with a TD pass.  He is a great guy and player. 

At the request of many- I will be doing live tweets during the next presidential debate. 

Great win last night for the @Yankees in Baltimore. 

Sleepy eyes @chucktodd is an absolute joke of a reporter.  He is in the bag for Obama.  He can't carry @jack_welch's jock. 

Who is more believable on the state of employment--the great @jack_welch or some government bureaucrat who is voting for Obama? 

It's great that sleepy eyes @chucktodd gets no traction. 

A record 46. 68M Americans are now on food stamps    Four more years? 

RT @IBDeditorials: Media Doesn't See Past Bin Laden to Obama's Failed Foreign Policy. 

I would do same thing if I were China.   They want Obama.. 

I told Alex Salmond that he should never have released al-Megrahi when he foolishly asked me for support! 

If Alex Salmond had not stupidly released terrorist al-Megrahi (PanAm flight 103) to his friends, there would be no Trump wind farm dispute. 

My @foxandfriends interview discussing Obama's failed and dangerous foreign policy and the real unemployment numbers. 

@1010winsnewyork . @1010WINSNewYork (news radio) has too many commercials--can't listen. 

UK has no money & yet they subsidize ugly Scottish wind farms--big outcry. 

@TheViewTV I'm doing @theviewtv today at 11 am--always interesting! 

Got to do something about these missing chidlren grabbed by the perverts.  Too many incidents--fast trial, death penalty. 

Just got back from Scotland and speech in London.  Amazing "packed house" crowd. 

More than 70M people watched the Presidential Debate.   A new record.   See what happens when I am so prominently mentioned (just kidding)! 

Looking forward to Sunday’s speech in the ExCel Centre.. 

“The team with the best players wins. ” -- @jack_welch\. 

@ACUConservative . @acuconservative's #CPACCO kept up the momentum from the debate.  @MittRomney even made a surprise appearance.  Now go win CO! 

Now America knows--the Emperor has no clothes.  Why would Obama do better in a 2nd debate?  #Debate #Obama\. 

My friend @GovChristie called it--@MittRomney recast the race. 

Glad to hear that @RobinRoberts is doing well.  She is a terrific person. 

I promise to do a new #trumpvlog when I get back next week---- lots of requests.  Thanks! 

"To every action there is always opposed an equal reaction. " --Isaac Newton\. 

Scary & Unsustainable: On Monday the US added more debt than from 1776 through Pearl Harbor. 

"Mr.  President, you're entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. " --@MittRomney\. 

Bill Clinton has been Obama's most effective surrogate out on the trail. 

Congrats to @Yankees on finishing 1st in the AL East.  Derek Jeter is great--good luck in the playoffs! 

I'll be in London on Sunday at the ExCel Centre to talk about success.  It will be a great time for everyone!. 

@HighTide1989 Amazing is good too. 

@CelebApprentice @LuLuCornbread @celebapprentice  Most likely in February. 

The upcoming season of @CelebApprentice will be terrific--a great cast. 

Now another Obama speech from 2002 with him talking about taking the rich's 'stuff'   Who is this guy?  Where's the media? 

Congratulations to Michelle and Barack Obama on their 20th anniversary. 

Happy to have just passed 1. 5M followers on twitter.  We picked up over 14,000 yesterday alone.  It's great to speak to everyone daily. 

I'm eagerly awaiting the next polls.  The debate performance could be devastating to the Obama team.  Let's see what happens. 

@TonyRobbins @FstLtd @FSTLTD @tonyrobbins  Will be a great event.  See you in London. 

Both being optimistic and remembering the big picture have served me well throughout my life.  You need to stay positive. 

. @SethMacFarlane will be a great Oscar host.  He did an amazing job at my @ComedyCentral roast. 

@Ajb073  Thank you. 

Wind farms are ugly, not cost effective and don't produce worthwhile returns or energy.  No wonder governments are giving up on them. 

As a big job creator, I was greatly honored to have been mentioned twice tonight during the debate. 

Congratulations to Mitt Romney.  He was not only good, he was absolutely fantastic tonight! 

"Invincibility lies in the defence; the possibility of victory in the attack. " --Sun Tzu\. 

There's only one candidate who cut medicare and that's Barack Obama.  Cut over $700M to move into ObamaCare. 

In August, 2012, Obama said the so called Arab Spring sprung from 'joyful longing for human freedom'     Good call! 

Have you heard?  China just told Obama to jump.  Obama asked how high. 

@Sappy4142  I agree\. 

Obama's '07 speech which @DailyCaller just released not only shows that Obama is a racist but also how the press always covers for him. 

I'm always amazed when I travel to my foreign properties. Seeing the Trump brand across 4 continents proves that excellence can be universal. 

@SiphoSimelane Thank you. 

@escobedoantonio Thank you\. 

@Lexi_Michaels  Yes, absolutely. 

@escobedoantonio Work hard and never give up! 

I will be visiting Trump Int'l Golf Links in Scotland tomorrow.  Always great to see the Great Dunes of Scotland.. 

Who is rooting for Obama more tonight--his campaign advisors or the press? 

Can't wait for tonight's debate--actually delayed my trip to Europe so I can watch.  This is going to be a great night. 

My @gretawire interview discussing @MittRomney debate responses, Obama's hidden records, my tweets and unemployment. 

I am very proud of Ivanka! 

My daughter Ivanka is being honored by the Wharton School of Finance with the 2012 Young Leadership Award.  Also (cont). 

@DavidRoyEarle See you in London--big crowd! 

Reverend Wright must have great hatred for Obama and the manner in which he was shunted aside. 

Obama called Reverend Wright his friend, counselor & great leader--then dumped him like a dog! 

See June 2007 speech--is Obama a total racist? 

Heading to London on Sunday to make a speech at ExCel Centre.     A sell out and looking forward to a great time. 

@_______romeo Thanks Mike\. 

@AmiciPhoto  You are right, Carrara is a great marble. 

Congratulations to Barack Obama for having 2012's debt already surpass 2011. 

The cheap 12 inch sq.  marble tiles behind speaker at UN always bothered me.  I will replace with beautiful large marble slabs if they ask me. 

Where is the main stream media reporting on Univision's new expose of Fast and Furious?  Too busy looking at Mitt's taxes? 

Major Mexican cartel boss El Diego was just arrested with weapons provided to him through Fast and Furious     Media?? 

A great article about how ObamaCare has even further complicated the tax code and will hurt housing market. 

. @ritter1025  Wishing your wife a Happy Birthday\. 

It's Tuesday, how much will the media continue to cover up the embassy attacks for Obama? 

@FoxNews I'll be on @gretawire tonight on @foxnews at 10 pm. 

@NFL Great to hear that @nfl legend and hall of famer John Elway has endorsed @MittRomney in Colorado.  CO is a must win state for Mitt. 

Under Obama, Iran has taken over Iraq, Al Qaeda has taken over Libya, the Muslim Brotherhood now controls Egypt.  Worst  foreign policy ever. 

Woody Johnson's comments that he would rather have @MittRomney win the election than his @nyjets win games shows real patriotism. 

The Chinese are now hacking White House computers.  Why not?  They already own the place. 

Big win by @Yankees last night to take control of AL East.  Jeter & company now control their destiny. 

Wednesday's debate is day one of the election.  Over 70 million voters will be watching. 

In Nov.  '11, Al Qaeda's flag flew over the 'birthplace' of Libya's revolution     In Sept.  '12 it flew over our Embassy. 

Glad to hear @SethMacFarlane will be hosting this year's Oscars.  Something new that should be fun. 

A clip from @KatieShow where I take @katiecouric's audience on the Katie Coach. 

My @SquawkCNBC #TrumpTuesday interview discussing how @MittRomney can win the first debate & the last 35 days. 

If Obama mentions Mitt's tax returns in tomorrow's debate then Mitt should immediately ask for Obama's college records & applications\. 

Obama is trying to block sequester layoff notices in Virginia   Another example of sleazy politics! 

Threatening phone calls from Obama supporters are being made to the Michigan GOP office    Don't be intimidated! 

Obama loves wasting our money.  He just made another guarantee of $197M to a solar company    Cronyism! 

Al Qaeda taking over Libya after we made it possible--really amazing. 

Venezuelan leader Hugo Chavez said in a television interview that aired on Sunday "If I were American, I'd vote for Obama. "

Big cancer risk from new "environmental" light bulbs"--a big price to pay! 

Obama now wants to give another $450M to the Muslim Brotherhood.  Money we don't have going to people that hate us.  Moronic. 

How many more of our soldiers have to be shot by the Afghanis they are training?  Let's get the hell out of there and focus on U. S.

@ACUConservative If you live in Colorado, make sure to go to @acuconservative's #CPACCO in Denver on Oct.  4.  Colorado is a must win state for Mitt! 

Bad news -- Chief Justice Roberts is back to deliver more BS   Roberts saved ObamaCare--very disloyal\. 

Obama deserves much less credit for the killing of Bin Laden.  The praise goes to our brave military and intelligence officers. 

Tomorrow is #TrumpTuesday @SquawkCNBC 7:30 AM\. 

Lots of people agree that the Emmys were a joke--got bad ratings--no credibility! 

. @CheaterBella Thanks (I think)

. @WallStreetGreek Great Markos! 

Thank you Chicago Tribune--highest four star rating for Trump Int'l Hotel & Tower restaurant "Sixteen". 

Republicans and @MittRomney must get tough very soon. 

Only 36 days until the election.  @MittRomney needs to stay on offense.  Make Obama's terrible record the issue.  #TimeToGetTough\. 

In debate, @MittRomney should ask Obama why autobiography states "born in Kenya, raised in Indonesia. "

Read editorial in today's @WSJ by @MittRomney -- "A New Course for the Middle East".

. @IsraeliPM @netanyahu delivered an excellent speech yesterday at the UN.  Too bad @AmbassadorRice wasn't there. 

@Mr_Schwab You have to love what you do and keep your focus at all times. 

Brits spent $57. 8M on the royal family.  Obamas cost us $1. 4B in expenses--including entertainment   Living large on us. 

It's amazing how different all of the polling results are--not an exact science.

Someone must be fired at @AOL for that stupid deal they made buying Huffington Post. 

. @MittRomney must ask for Obama's college records & applications--why is he not doing this? 

China's Financial Institutions are expanding overseas.   They will own everything if we don't stop them now. 

ObamaCare is a failure.  Costs are rising much faster under Obama than other Presidents. 

Now Obama's campaign is guaranteeing 12 million new jobs during a 2nd term      More like $12T in new debt if he wins. 

A resort in Arizona is using sewage to make snow.  Environmentalists are going crazy--I won't be skiing in that snow. 

I have fun, I love what I do.  You should too.  Find out how at the National Achievers Conference this October in London.

@RandySpangler Thank you. 

Just bought the Kluge Estate in Charlottesville, Virginia (don't worry, only business).  See Washington Post article. 

Jerry Falwell, Jr.  stated speech was best in University's history... my great honor. 

Liberty University speech by DJT was biggest by far in school's history.  Standing ovations... great young people! 

Associated Press knowingly and inaccurately wrote about Liberty University speech.  Shameful reporting... no credibility. 

Huff post gets it wrong re: Ferry Point... the only leakage of gas is from Arianna Huffington. 

No matter how good the replacement refs do, they will be soundly criticized--they can't win! 

China has done very well under Obama.  Now they just released their first aircraft carrier. 

China is filling the vacuum left by Obama at the UN on the world stage.

Aspirin gets the best press of almost anything I can think of---fact or great PR? 

Obama's complaints about Republicans stopping his agenda are BS since he had full control for two years.  He can never take responsibility. 

Obama's new excuse for his failures is that you "can't change Washington from the inside. " Not what he said in '09..

Home values have sunk a record 15% under Obama. 

The debates are going to have a big impact on the election.  @MittRomney has proved--in Florida--he delivers under pressure. 

Secure your place at the National Achievers Congress in London.  It will be an amazing event with a great surprise.. 

Living in denial--only 15% of Democrats think that recent economic news is poor.

Congratulations to Brandt Snedeker on his $11. 4M payday on Sunday by winning the Tour Championship and FedEX Cup.  Well done. 

RT @MittRomney: I am running for president to get us creating wealth again--not to redistribute it. 

With Obama and Bernanke destroying the value of the dollar, gold and real estate should continue to rise in value. 

The attack on our Libyan consulate was the worst attack on the US since 9/11.  Time for Obama to come clean. 

Despite all of China's cheating, they are not doing that well--we can beat them--our country has great potential! 

All these polls released by news outlets are oversampling Democrats.  They want to influence public perception of the race. 

The Emmys are all politics, that's why, despite nominations, The Apprentice never won--even though it should have many times over. 

"Amazing Race" winning an Emmy again is a total joke.  The Emmys have no credibility--no wonder the ratings are at record lows. 

Despite the Emmy's being terrible as a show, @jimmykimmel was excellent--and I think his late night show will be a hit. 

The Emmys were horrendous... the absolute worst show! 

My @guardian interview "This much I know" discussing business, Prince Harry, Barack Obama and religion. 

My @foxandfriends interview discussing visiting @LibertyU, Obama's failed foreign policy and the 2012 election. 

@LibertyU @MicheleBachmann  It was an honor for me.  Thank you. 

With all of the bad economic numbers and horrendous foreign policy, Obama should be down by 12 points--and he's not. 

Will be doing #TrumpTuesday on @SquawkCNBC earlier tomorrow (7 AM) as I start shooting @CelebApprentice.  Joe, Becky & Andrew = a great team.

Isn’t it great that Obama had time yesterday to fundraise with Jay Z and do @Late_Show while there is a record 21% real unemployment! 

QE3, a political favor for Obama, will cause record inflation on food and fuel.   This hits low income families the hardest.  Big mistake.

Liberal press won't look into why Obama ignored security warnings for embassies but is obsessed with Romney's private comments. 

None of Romney's leaked comments change the fact that Obama is a complete disaster.  20% real unemployment and $6T in deficit spending. 

It's Tuesday.  How many more non-stories will the liberal media try to manufacture so everyone ignores Obama's record? 

The majority of Americans agree with @MittRomney's comments on @Israel and Iran. 

With 49 days until the election, @MittRomney needs to stay on offense.  He should not be apologizing.  Deflect onto Obama's record.

Welcome to Obama's America--record high poverty and an 8% drop in median household family income    Four more years?

Obama's convention bounce is gone.  @MittRomney has retaken the lead in the latest @RasmussenPoll.

I will be speaking Monday, September 24, (10 A. M. ) at Liberty University, to a record setting student body.  I look forward to it! 

The media is pathetic.  Our embassies are savaged by radicals while Obama does nothing and all they can do is criticize @MittRomney. 

What a coincidence that Obama's good friends in Libya and Egypt picked 9/11 to attack our embassies. 

With allies like Egypt and Libya, who needs enemies?! 

Shouldn't there have been increased security at our embassies on the anniversary of 9/11? 

@nbc Obama told @NBC that Egypt is no longer an ally.  They used to be until he pushed out Mubarak. 

Filming of the record 13th season of @CelebApprentice has started.  Be sure to be on the lookout for future updates. 

Wake Up America!   See article: "Israeli Science: Obama Birth Certificate is a Fake". 

If Obama was smart, he would cancel the Muslim Brotherhood's WH visit later this month.  He won't.

Obama's foreign policy is a complete and total disaster--the worst President we have ever had. 

We threw our ally Mubarak overboard and Egypt is now our enemy.  Great going Obama--Israel is in trouble. 

This is all about American weakness and an incompetent President. 

We helped Libya & they killed our Ambassador & other Americans.  I told you then we made a mistake in backing the (cont).

"The only place success comes before work is in the dictionary. " -- Vince Lombardi\.

OPEC will use yesterday's attacks on our embassies to raise the price of gas.  They are always ripping us off. 

It's Wednesday, how many more of our embassies will be stormed by Islamists? 

What did we get for fighting in Libya besides a dead Ambassador.  Demand their oil. 

As bad as they were, I don't remember our embassies being attacked when Mubarak and Gaddafi were in power. 

The Middle East is blowing up--we didn't back Egypt and now they riot against us.  Iran is using Iraqi airspace, (cont). 

Obama is a disaster at foreign policy.  Never had the experience or knowledge.  He is not capable of doing the job.

China is an international pariah.  They are now harassing Japan over its purchase of 3 uninhabited islands. 

Why won't Obama release his college applications?  Is there something 'foreign' about them? 

84% of US troops wounded & 70% of our brave men & women killed in Afghanistan have all come under Obama.  Time to get out of there. 

Whatever happened to Obama's 'independent investigation' into national security leaks from his administration?  Where's the media?

One of the best moves I ever made was staying out of last decade's artificial real estate boom.  But I used the downturn to my advantage. 

During @BarackObama's presidency, median family income has fallen 4. 8%    Terrible for the middle class. 

A lot of people strongly advised me against doing @ApprenticeNBC.  Next week we start filming the record 13th seasonHence, go with your gut! 

If @BarackObama had to use the same labor participation he had when he entered office then the unemployment number would be 11. 2%

This chart from AEI's @JimPethokoukis shows how terrible @BarackObama's 'recovery' really is:     Disaster. 

Unemployment rate only dropped because more people are out of labor force & have stopped looking for work. Not a real recovery, phony numbers\. 

There are now 119,000 fewer Americans employed than there were in July.  The economy is still terrible. 

Today's job report is dismal.  Now a record 88,921,000 Americans are no longer in the work force. 

Drew Peterson, a real sleaze, just convicted of killing wife.  Change the law so he gets death penalty. 

Dems had a very good and professional convention.  The Republicans must be smart and tough--and fast! 

The Republicans must get Virgil Goode out of the race in Virginia.  He will take votes away from @MittRomney. 

The YouTube of the 2012 Miss USA contestants, @GiulianaRancic and me singing "Call Me Maybe"      has over 2M views. 

Under @BarackObama, 1 out of every 7 Americans is on food stamps. 

Scary--while @BarackObama has been POTUS for 1. 6% of America's history, he has amassed 33. 3% of the total debt. 

"We've gone from $10 trillion that the president inherited from all prior presidents to $16 trillion" -- @MittRomney\. 

"Forty-seven million now on food stamps.  When he came to office there were 32 million.  He's added 15 million people. " --@MittRomney\. 

The Chinese are mistreating Hillary Clinton on her trip    They have zero respect for us.  Outrageous! 

Remember while @BarackObama is lauding himself tonight with self-indulgent compliments we have our brave soldiers fighting in Afghanistan. 

After @BarackObama's speech tonight--which should be well delivered--reality will hit Friday morning when the new jobs report is released. 

The delegates at the @DNC convention keep shouting "Four More Years. " Four more years of 18% real unemployment and another $6T in debt? 

Now we will never know if @BarackObama would have been able to fill Bank of America Stadium.  Pretty convenient. 

. @BarackObama is now taking credit for changing party platform language but he reviewed it prior to the convention. 

"Donald Trump Has Given Millions To Pro-Romney SuperPACs and His Whole Family Is Cutting Checks to Mitt's Campaign". 

Iran is flying supply planes to Syria through Iraqi airspace.  Thank you, United States, for making this possible! 

Bill Clinton did a great job last night--the Democrats are lucky to have him.  Do you really believe he likes @BarackObama? 

Once again under@BarackObama, the US has fallen down the ranks of global competitiveness     We must do better. 

Other networks are begging me to do a show--I can't because I'm doing the Apprentice!

Very good speech by @MichelleObama--and under great pressure--Dems should be proud! 

No surprise.  @BarackObama is letting the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt default on their US loans    Big mistake! 

July U. S.  construction had biggest drop in 12months.  Bad indicator on economic numbers for rest of the year. 

What message does it send when @BarackObama's campaign has to spin whether America is better off than it was 4 years ago? 

OPEC is better off than they were 4 years ago.  Gas has more than doubled during @BarackObama's term.  Outrageous! 

The Chinese are better off than they were 4 years ago.  They have stolen even more from us in jobs & trade during @BarackObama's term. 

China now 'warns' us against being involved in sea disputes. 

NBC Wall St Journal Poll of African American voters: 94% @BarackObama, 0% @MittRomney. Even worse than Hillary's old numbers.  Is that racism? 

With our national debt passing $16T during the @DNC convention, @BarackObama has amassed more debt than the first 42 presidents.  Scary. 

Record setting gas prices in the U. S.  -- we're really looking dumb.  Lots of $'s being made on us. 

The media can track down @PaulRyan's old girlfriend and marathon time but can't find @BarackObama's college applications or other info. 

Smart move by @BarackObama having Pres.  Bill Clinton deliver the @DNC convention keynote. 

This week the @DNC convention will deliver hard hits on @MittRomney.  @RNC will regret being soft on @BarackObama last week. 

. @RobinRoberts of @GMA is terrific--get better soon.

Slight conflict--I like @davidaxelrod--he called me and said great things about my daughter @IvankaTrump. 

. @sethmeyers21 bombed again.  Didn't get co-host job with @KellyRipa.  He would not have delivered the ratings anyway. Michael S will be great.

It's amazing how much people are enjoying playing at the Trump Scotland course.  The dunes are absolutely incredible.. 

As I predicted 1 year ago, gasoline prices hit a record high today... OPEC is having a ball at our expense. 

Great going Andy Roddick!  Another victory for a fabulous player.  Brooklyn Decker is good luck. 

I win awards for speaking-but the enemies either won't comment or will say only bad... leave Clint alone! 

If you have a speech-one that would put Winston Churchill to shame, liberals would find a way to make it sound terrible! 

@MELANIATRUMP on @QVC tonight with her fabulous Melania Timepieces & Jewelry.  Tune in at 1AM EST! 

Republicans are always saying Obama is such a nice guy.  When will they learn that he is not? 

Andy Roddick... a great tennis player is a fantastic guy with a wonderful wife. 

Republicans should have been much tougher on Obama.  Just wait until you see what Obama does to Romney at the DNC! 

China is now deploying drones across ocean routes used for trade   They stole the technology from us. 

. @BarackObama's assault on coal and gas and oil will send energy and manufacturing jobs to China. " --@MittRomney\. 

I am sure the Chinese are getting anxious.  They watch the polls.  @MittRomney won't let them cheat us anymore. 

We have all the cards.  Now is the time to make a great deal with Iran.

Gas prices are about to hit a record high during the Labor Day weekend.  @BarackObama could have stopped this. 

It's Friday, how many advertisers dropped @HuffPost today? 

A fact--golfers don't get aches & pains like others who don't golf.  It is amazingly remedial. 

Of course @hardball_chris attacked 'birthers' in praising @CondoleezzaRice's speech.  Chris has completely lost it. 

Letterman @Late_Show begging me to go back on his low rated show--calls lots--must apologize for racist comment. 

Too busy playing golf?  @BarackObama sends form letters with an electronic  signature to the parents of fallen SEALs. 

@paulryanvp I am impressed with how clearly @PaulRyanVP explains the challenges we face and the solutions @MittRomney will bring as President. 

Book on Bin Laden is a terrible violation of code--makes @BarackObama's story a big lie. 

@paulryanvp I wonder what @JoeBiden was thinking last night as @PaulRyanVP delivered that knockout speech.  Joe should call in sick for the VP debate. 

@paulryanvp "After four  years of getting the run-around, America needs a turnaround, and the man for the job is Governor Mitt Romney. " @PaulRyanVP\. 

The dummies left Iraq (and Libya) without the oil! 

@govmike "Let me say it as clearly as possible, that the attack on my Catholic brothers and sisters is an attack on me. " -- @GovMike Huckabee\. 

Congratulations to @GovMikeHuckabee on last night's tremendous speech.  Mike united the party faithful and explained that we can do better. 

Only two weeks until we start shooting @CelebApprentice.  We really have something amazing for the fans this year. 

Gas prices are way too high.  With an economy contracting and lower demand, how do OPEC & the speculators get away with this?! 

Even the SEALS who killed Bin Laden don't like @JoeBiden. 

It's Thursday and again I ask--how much money is China stealing from us? 

I was putting together my early deals in New York & I was advised by many that I was too young.  Believe in yourself & you can do anything. 

China's media is attacking @MittRomney while endorsing @BarackObama    Of course.  Mitt knows it's Time To Get Tough. 

I am astonished that the media continues to lie.  @BarackObama gutted welfare reform.  It is a fact!

Congratulations to @AnnDRomney on delivering a knock out speech last night.  America can't wait to call her our First Lady. 

An excerpt of my @TheBrodyFile interview at the Sarasota 'Statesman of the Year' dinner discussing the Tea Party. 

China must be worried that @MittRomney will win this November.  They have never had such a pushover like @BarackObama. 

What a coincidence--Michelle Obama called Kenya @BarackObama's "homeland" in 2008. 

. @BarackObama's dismal job record is reason alone that he must be defeated this November. 

I am very worried that if @BarackObama is re-elected then Medicare will be destroyed.  We must take care of our seniors. 

I can't wait to read this... RT @Newsmax_Media: SEAL Book Explodes, Obama Furious. 

. @BarackObama's Super PAC has continually called @MittRomney a "murderer"     Ironic since Obama is destroying Medicare. 

"I stand ready to lead us down a new path, where we are lifted up by our desire to succeed, not by a resentment of success. " -- @MittRomney\. 

It's Tuesday--how much inflation has @BarackObama's spending caused today on the price of food and gas? 

. @GovChristie is going to do a fantastic job tonight explaining why @MittRomney  should be elected and @BarackObama has to go. 

. @MELANIATRUMP and I are looking forward to watching @AnnDRomney's speech tonight.  She is an amazing woman who will be a great First Lady! 

Happy to hear that @ralphreed's Faith and Freedom chapters are at the @RNC convention supporting @MittRomney.  We must be united to win! 

Remember when @ariannahuff ran for Governor of California.  She got 3 votes.

My @FoxNews @TeamCavuto interview discussing the @RNC Convention, businesses making products in China and unemployment. 

The Bay Bridge in San Francisco is being built by the Chinese--tremendous cost overruns.  A total mess.  We should build our own bridges, etc\. 

Don't think my statement on @ariannahuff was harsh, if you knew her and the phony Huffington Post you would understand--- more to follow. 

. @ariannahuff is unattractive both inside and out.  I fully understand why her former husband left her for a man- he made a good decision. 

. @FinancialTimes writes that "@BarackObama should pray that China overtakes US"    Don't worry, he is making it happen. 

The US Navy wants to go "green. " Our Navy should use the best & most powerful fuel & not play games.  Give me a break! 

As usual, the weather people got it wrong in Tampa.  They just look for headlines & ratings! 

Media silent when @BarackObama  called @MittRomney a murderer & felon.  Mitt mentions 'birth certificate' and they go nuts.  Double standard! 

If the Democrats want to attack 'Birthers' then they should at least spell it correctly. 

. @BarackObama has completely failed the American people.  U. S.  annual incomes have fallen over 5% during his term. 

"They succeed, because they think they can. " -- Virgil\.

Sorry to hear of the passing of Neil Armstrong over the weekend.  He was an American hero. 

One point I made last night and will continue to push is that the @GOP can't be pollitically correct.  We must fight fire with fire. 

. @FLGovScott is doing a fantastic job not only hosting the @RNC convention but managing Hurricane Isaac.  A true leader. 

. @Reince Priebus is doing a great job--fantastic guy.  But no more birther apologies. 

I knew Chris Matthews when he was sane and, quite honestly, wonderful.  Now he's gone off the deep end as an Obama surrogate.  @hardball_chris\. 

While @MittRomney only made a joke last Friday, he touched on an issue that is very serious to millions of Americans.

Nice letter from Macy's great & talented boss, Terry L.. 

Great evening in Sarasota FL last night.  Record crowd--I loved the people & the energy. 

"The toughest thing about success is that you've got to keep on being a success. " --Irving Berlin\. 

. @BarackObama is begging the Eurozone to keep Greece in until after 11. 6. 12.  He thinks the world revolves around his re-election. 

What priorities -- we have over 20% real unemployment and no growth. 

. @BarackObama sent over 100,000 jobs and Canadian oil to China all because he would not approve Keystone XL. 

I am sure the @NCGOP will do a great job bracketing the @DNC convention.  They are a tremendous statewide organization. 

It's Friday.  How many bald eagles did wind turbines kill today?  They are an environmental & aesthetic disaster. 

. @DineshDSouza's '2016: Obama's America' is expanding to over 1,000 theaters this weekend.  Will be highest grossing documentary in 2012.  !!

Life brings you many surprises.  As a child I used to vacation with my family at the Doral in Miami.  Now I own it.. 

Here is a letter I received yesterday from someone who has had personal experience with our health care situation.. 

I am proud of the Tea Party.  These great patriots have accomplished so much in strengthening our country in only 3 short years. 

Disgusting--@BarackObama's supporters are launching an anti-Mormon whisper campaign    Shameful but no surprise. 

. @BarackObama is bankrupting this country.  His budget adds another $4. 4T to the debt, putting us over $20T in total debt by 2016.

. @MittRomney will make us energy independent by 2020   @BarackObama will keep wasting money on Solyndra projects.

Putin just sent a Russian nuclear sub to the Gulf of Mexico.  @BarackObama can't be bothered, he is too concerned with @MittRomney's taxes. 

Gas prices are soaring.  $4. 12 in CA.  OPEC is laughing at how stupid we are. 

. @BarackObama was caught telling Russian PM @MedvedevRussiaE that he can be more 'flexible' in his second term.  Russia thinks he's weak.

I am tired of @BarackObama talking about @MittRomney's father.  Why don't we discuss Barack Obama Sr.!

RT @IBDeditorials: Was Barack Obama A Foreign Exchange Student?. 

Waste--@BarackObama's Dep.  of Energy was warned in advance by Treasury that it wasn't loaning $ out in good deals. 

Sad--only 36% think America's best days are ahead while 49% believe they are in the past    We can & must do better.

Waste.  With 22 new taxes & $1. 8T in added debt, @BarackObama's disgraceful 'ObamaCare' will still leave 30M uninsured. 

Just letting China know in advance that the USA will win the medal count in the Olympics.  Even with your cheating you can't beat us. 

. @MacMiller's 'Donald Trump' song is at 64. 5M views on YouTube    You're welcome Mac! 

Even more @BarackObama crony capitalism & corruption.  We are guaranteeing a $105M loan to another Obama donor. 

See Newsmax story re Republican National Convention.

"Americans never quit. " -- General Douglas MacArthur\. 

The brand new season of @CelebApprentice starts filming in less than 5 weeks.  The 'All Star' cast will be announced very soon.

"Act as if what you do makes a difference.  It does. "  -- William James\. 

. @BarackObama-Hood: Rob our children's future by borrowing from the Chinese to pay for socialist programs that will bankrupt us. 

No surprise that China was caught cheating in the Olympics.  That's the Chinese M. O.  - Lie, Cheat & Steal in all international dealings. 

Pathetic--@BarackObama is 'sweetening' his offer to the Taliban   Read 'The Art of The Deal. '

People are finally beginning to hit China and OPEC.  They never give me credit for being the first--by far--but that's okay! 

Looking forward to meeting the great folks of Sarasota GOP party when I am honored as 'Statesman of the Year. ' Should be a wonderful time.

A 'confidential source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama has added over $6T to the new national debt &  ruined US credit. 

Glad to hear that @FLGovScott will be speaking at the @RNC Convention.  He is a true conservative and fantastic governor! 

To the geniuses at 'Americans United for Change': the more you tax me the less people I employ.  Get it? 

Now the world is looking to China for an economic 'lift'   @BarackObama has ruined our economic hegemony. 

I have founded and run one of the largest real estate empires in the world.  I employ thousands of people.  Why am I the enemy? 

@WhiteHouse The @whitehouse has 'clarified' that the unemployment is actually 8. 254% not 8. 3%     A little sensitive are we? 

The real outsourcer - @BarackObama is funding German automakers with the GM bailout money    How does that help us?

Congratulations to @BarackObama--yesterday marked the 1 YR anniversary of our country's credit being downgraded. 

The Senate should be more concerned about actually passing a budget than spreading lies about @MittRomney's taxes. 

The Fed should not do another 'stimulus. ' We can't keep spending our children's future away on waste. 

@WhiteHouse Convenient - David Plouffe collected $100G fee from Iranian affiliate only a month before joining @whitehouse. 

Wrong--@BarackObama's '08 campaign manager & current Senior WH Advisor collected $100G fee from Iranian affiliate. 

. @MittRomney will create 2 million new jobs if elected POTUS.   If reelected, @BarackObama will create over $12T in new debt.  Easy choice.

In his entire political career, @BarackObama has never had a tough @GOP opponent before @MittRomney.  He is a paper tiger.  #GOMITT\. 

The Football program at Penn State should be suspended. 

Penn State is doing a poor job in bringing its mess to a close. They should be ashamed for hiding Sandusky's crimes all these years... 

A true honor.  @PressSec considers asking for @BarackObama's college transcripts a "Donald Trump question. "    Release it! 

But the attention @BarackObama gets for not doing so covers up his ineffective record as President. 

. @BarackObama should release all his records (like other Presidents).... 

While @CNN is struggling with ratings, @piersmorgan is consistently doing well.  Congrats to Piers! 

Sad--OPEC has really cornered the market.  Now @AP lauds $85/barrel    Crude shouldn't cost more than $25. 

Don't believe the lies--every budget @BarackObama has delivered to Congress raises the income tax on EVERYONE. 

Think of it---20% of our country is essentially unemployed. 

The underemployment being quoted as 14. 9% is way low--real number could be 20%. 

. @BarackObama wants to see 10 yrs of @MittRomney's tax returns--tell him "ok--but we want to see your college applications first. '

Nasty  tactics being used by @BarackObama campaign against @MittRomney.  Must stop saying Obama is a nice man--he is not! 

. @BarackObama finally talking tough on China.  He's repeating my exact words.  Where has he been for 4 years? 

America's Olympic uniforms are manufactured in China.  Burn the uniforms! #U. S. OlympicCommittee\. 

The House voting to repeal was the first bipartisan vote on ObamaCare.  The GOP must continue to Repeal, Defund, Disrupt!  #BARACKTAX\. 

The 18th hole at Trump International Golf Links Scotland-. 

I wonder why @BarackObama is not going to the NAACP Convention.  Is it because he can't answer questions about 14. 7% Black unemployment? 

Seth Meyers was terrible co-hosting with Kelly.  Marbles in his mouth-& he must stop picking at his hands--insult to the great Regis Philbin!

Even the Left realizes that @BarackObama's policies have led to more jobs being outsourced out of this country.. 

Almost daily more discrepancies in @BarackObama's biography continue to arise.  Who is this guy? 

Very strange--why do database records contradict @BarackObama and show he was only at Columbia 1 year?. 

"There's no bigger name in America than Donald Trump, political or nonpolitical. " --Sarasota GOP Chair Joe Gruters\. 

Today @MittRomney addressed the NAACP.  @BarackObama takes their vote for granted which is why there is such high Black unemployment.

The U-6 Unemployment Rate is over 14. 9%.  ObamaCare is stopping businesses from both hiring and expanding. 

Pathetic--DNC Chair @DWStweets is "Happy" with 8. 2% unemployment   We must do better.  #GOMITT\. 

Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?  This is the latest. 

Pathetic--@BarackObama called 8. 2% unemployment a "Step in the RIght Direction". 

Message working--over 80% of likely US voters nationwide believe @MittRomney will repeal ObamaCare on Day One. 

like other Presidents have. 

. @MittRomney should not give any other further information until @BarackObama releases the things that everyone wants to see----

Do you really think @BarackObama will reveal his college applications and records?  I don't. 

President Obama wants @MittRomney to hand over even more past tax returns- he should when @BarackObama reveals his college applications. 

I'm in Scotland to open what we hope to be the greatest golf course in the world--- it's amazing.

Today @BarackObama is in Ohio on a bus tour.  Tomorrow Pennsylvania.  How about actually running the country? 

May jobless numbers have been readjusted to 8. 2%.   @BarackObama's economy is a disaster   New numbers tomorrow.

Degenerate former Congressman Anthony Weiner is trying to make a comeback.  He is a sick & perverted man that New York does not want or need. 

Justice Roberts changed his vote in order to make the media happy.  He was intimidated by the press.

Why is @BarackObama continuing to lie?    has found that @MittRomney did not ship jobs overseas. 

Happy to have just passed 1. 3M Twitter followers.  Love communicating with everyone daily. 

David Wright of the NY Mets should have been on the 1st Team All Stars.  He's having a great year. 

Don't believe @BarackObama's whining--Pro-Romney SuperPAC spending is on par with Pro-Obama SuperPAC.

Many Democrats up for reelection in 2012 are skipping the DNC convention in Charlotte   Smart politics! 

Watch the WH spokesman try to spin @BarackObama's rationale for using exec.  priv.  on Fast & Furious.

Fast & Furious traces to @BarackObama--he made a pre-Inaugural "Pledge" to Mexican Pres.  Calderon to "take action". 

The @BarackObama campaign took in $39M in May but spent $44. 6M.  Sound familiar! 

The new @DarKnightRises trailer is fantastic    Trump Tower stood in for Wayne Enterprises during filming. 

Fast & Furious directly resulted in the death of US Border Agent Brian Terry.  Sad!

My @SquawkCNBC interview re: Europe's financial mess, investing in Spain, Germany's economy and the future of the Euro.

I don't mind that @BarackObama plays a lot of golf.  I just wish he used it productively to make deals with Congress! 

Russia's recent actions in Syria have proven @MittRomney right.  @BarackObama offers Putin "flexibility. " @MittRomney will exert influence. 

Great @NBA finals game last night.  @MickyArison's @MiamiHEAT are doing well--and so is Micky.

3 Chief of Staffs in less than 3 years of being President: Part of the reason why @BarackObama can't manage to pass his agenda. 

New Hampshire has a major decision to make today.  Hopefully we won't have to hear any more Mandarin spoken in future debates.

Michele Bachmann got less than 1,200 more votes in the Caucus than she did in the Ames Straw Poll.  Very sad for her--a nice woman!

The safest way to preserve Medicare is with a robust and vibrant economy.  We should lower corporate and capital gain taxes immediately. 

A week after Biden says that the Taliban is not our enemy, the Taliban demand that we pay Iraq for a 9 year occupation.. 

Even if @BarackObama stays in DC, taxpayers will pay millions for his Hawaii vacation when Americans are struggling.

Iraq in political turmoil one day after we leave---I told you so. 

Even @BarackObama's former National Security Advisor Jim Jones has called the Keystone pipeline  'a national must. ' America needs it. 

Congratulations to my son Eric for making the Forbes 30 under 30 list.  He's done a great job!. 

Barney Frank admited that ObamaCare does have 'death panels' yesterday.  Obamacare must be fully repealed or healthcare will be destroyed. 

With a record deficit and $15 trillion in debt, @BarackObama is spending $4 million of our money on his Hawaii vacation.  Just plain wrong.

OPEC is setting crude at $94/barrel on 'signs US economy is improving. ' OPEC uses any excuse to rip us off and our leaders just watch.

@BarackObama has accumulated more debt in 3 years than the first 42 Presidents combined.  He is simply out of control. 

Why did @BarackObama let Iran keep our drone?  Now it is going straight to the Chinese.  He should have taken it out.
